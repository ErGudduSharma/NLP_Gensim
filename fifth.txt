A CAVIL ON CHRONOLOGY 
It has been a while between books, I know. So a reminder may be in order. 
The book you hold in your hands is the fifth volume of A Song of Ice and Fire. The fourth volume 
was A Feast for Crows. However, this volume does not follow that one in the traditional sense, so much 
as run in tandem with it. 
Both Dance and Feast take up the story immediately after the events of the third volume in the 
series, A Storm of Swords. Whereas Feast focused on events in and around King’s Landing, on the Iron 
Islands, and down in Dorne, Dance takes us north to Castle Black and the Wall (and beyond), and across 
the narrow sea to Pentos and Slaver’s Bay, to pick up the tales of Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, Daenerys 
Targaryen, and all the other characters you did not see in the preceding volume. Rather than being 
sequential, the two books are parallel … divided geographically, rather than chronologically. 
But only up to a point. 
A Dance with Dragons is a longer book than A Feast for Crows, and covers a longer time period. 
In the latter half of this volume, you will notice certain of the viewpoint characters from A Feast for 
Crows popping up again. And that means just what you think it means: the narrative has moved past the 
time frame of Feast, and the two streams have once again rejoined each other. 
Next up, The Winds of Winter. Wherein, I hope, everybody will be shivering together once 
again…

PROLOGUE 
The night was rank with the smell of man. 
The warg stopped beneath a tree and sniffed, his grey-brown fur dappled by shadow. A sigh of 
piney wind brought the man-scent to him, over fainter smells that spoke of fox and hare, seal and stag, 
even wolf. Those were man-smells too, the warg knew; the stink of old skins, dead and sour, near 
drowned beneath the stronger scents of smoke and blood and rot. Only man stripped the skins from 
other beasts and wore their hides and hair. 
Wargs have no fear of man, as wolves do. Hate and hunger coiled in his belly, and he gave a low 
growl, calling to his one-eyed brother, to his small sly sister. As he raced through the trees, his 
packmates followed hard on his heels. They had caught the scent as well. As he ran, he saw through 
their eyes too and glimpsed himself ahead. The breath of the pack puffed warm and white from long 
grey jaws. Ice had frozen between their paws, hard as stone, but the hunt was on now, the prey ahead. 
Flesh, the warg thought, meat. 
A man alone was a feeble thing. Big and strong, with good sharp eyes, but dull of ear and deaf to 
smells. Deer and elk and even hares were faster, bears and boars fiercer in a fight. But men in packs 
were dangerous. As the wolves closed on the prey, the warg heard the wailing of a pup, the crust of last 
night’s snow breaking under clumsy man-paws, the rattle of hardskins and the long grey claws men 
carried. 
Swords, a voice inside him whispered, spears. 
The trees had grown icy teeth, snarling down from the bare brown branches. One Eye ripped 
through the undergrowth, spraying snow. His packmates followed. Up a hill and down the slope beyond, 
until the wood opened before them and the men were there. One was female. The fur-wrapped bundle 
she clutched was her pup. Leave her for last, the voice whispered, the males are the danger. They were 
roaring at each other as men did, but the warg could smell their terror. One had a wooden tooth as tall 
as he was. He flung it, but his hand was shaking and the tooth sailed high. 
Then the pack was on them. 
His one-eyed brother knocked the tooth-thrower back into a snowdrift and tore his throat out as 
he struggled. His sister slipped behind the other male and took him from the rear. That left the female 
and her pup for him. 

She had a tooth too, a little one made of bone, but she dropped it when the warg’s jaws closed 
around her leg. As she fell, she wrapped both arms around her noisy pup. Underneath her furs the 
female was just skin and bones, but her dugs were full of milk. The sweetest meat was on the pup. The 
wolf saved the choicest parts for his brother. All around the carcasses, the frozen snow turned pink and 
red as the pack filled its bellies. 
Leagues away, in a one-room hut of mud and straw with a thatched roof and a smoke hole and a 
floor of hard-packed earth, Varamyr shivered and coughed and licked his lips. His eyes were red, his lips 
cracked, his throat dry and parched, but the taste of blood and fat filled his mouth, even as his swollen 
belly cried for nourishment. A child’s flesh, he thought, remembering Bump. Human meat. Had he sunk 
so low as to hunger after human meat? He could almost hear Haggon growling at him. “Men may eat 
the flesh of beasts and beasts the flesh of men, but the man who eats the flesh of man is an 
abomination.” 
Abomination. That had always been Haggon’s favorite word. Abomination, abomination, 
abomination. To eat of human meat was abomination, to mate as wolf with wolf was abomination, and 
to seize the body of another man was the worst abomination of all. Haggon was weak, afraid of his own 
power. He died weeping and alone when I ripped his second life from him. Varamyr had devoured his 
heart himself. He taught me much and more, and the last thing I learned from him was the taste of 
human flesh. 
That was as a wolf, though. He had never eaten the meat of men with human teeth. He would 
not grudge his pack their feast, however. The wolves were as famished as he was, gaunt and cold and 
hungry, and the prey … two men and a woman, a babe in arms, fleeing from defeat to death. They would 
have perished soon in any case, from exposure or starvation. This way was better, quicker. A mercy. 
“A mercy,” he said aloud. His throat was raw, but it felt good to hear a human voice, even his 
own. The air smelled of mold and damp, the ground was cold and hard, and his fire was giving off more 
smoke than heat. He moved as close to the flames as he dared, coughing and shivering by turns, his side 
throbbing where his wound had opened. Blood had soaked his breeches to the knee and dried into a 
hard brown crust. 
Thistle had warned him that might happen. “I sewed it up the best I could,” she’d said, “but you 
need to rest and let it mend, or the flesh will tear open again.” 
Thistle had been the last of his companions, a spearwife tough as an old root, warty, windburnt, 
and wrinkled. The others had deserted them along the way. One by one they fell behind or forged 
ahead, making for their old villages, or the Milkwater, or Hardhome, or a lonely death in the woods. 
Varamyr did not know, and could not care. I should have taken one of them when I had the chance. One 
of the twins, or the big man with the scarred face, or the youth with the red hair. He had been afraid, 
though. One of the others might have realized what was happening. Then they would have turned on 
him and killed him. And Haggon’s words had haunted him, and so the chance had passed. 

After the battle there had been thousands of them struggling through the forest, hungry, 
frightened, fleeing the carnage that had descended on them at the Wall. Some had talked of returning 
to the homes that they’d abandoned, others of mounting a second assault upon the gate, but most were 
lost, with no notion of where to go or what to do. They had escaped the black-cloaked crows and the 
knights in their grey steel, but more relentless enemies stalked them now. Every day left more corpses 
by the trails. Some died of hunger, some of cold, some of sickness. Others were slain by those who had 
been their brothers-in-arms when they marched south with Mance Rayder, the King-Beyond-the-Wall. 
Mance is fallen, the survivors told each other in despairing voices, Mance is taken, Mance is 
dead. “Harma’s dead and Mance is captured, the rest run off and left us,” Thistle had claimed, as she 
was sewing up his wound. “Tormund, the Weeper, Sixskins, all them brave raiders. Where are they 
now?” 
She does not know me, Varamyr realized then, and why should she? Without his beasts he did 
not look like a great man. I was Varamyr Six-skins, who broke bread with Mance Rayder. He had named 
himself Varamyr when he was ten. A name fit for a lord, a name for songs, a mighty name, and 
fearsome. Yet he had run from the crows like a frightened rabbit. The terrible Lord Varamyr had gone 
craven, but he could not bear that she should know that, so he told the spearwife that his name was 
Haggon. Afterward he wondered why that name had come to his lips, of all those he might have chosen. 
I ate his heart and drank his blood, and still he haunts me. 
One day, as they fled, a rider came galloping through the woods on a gaunt white horse, 
shouting that they all should make for the Milkwater, that the Weeper was gathering warriors to cross 
the Bridge of Skulls and take the Shadow Tower. Many followed him; more did not. Later, a dour warrior 
in fur and amber went from cookfire to cookfire, urging all the survivors to head north and take refuge 
in the valley of the Thenns. Why he thought they would be safe there when the Thenns themselves had 
fled the place Varamyr never learned, but hundreds followed him. Hundreds more went off with the 
woods witch who’d had a vision of a fleet of ships coming to carry the free folk south. “We must seek 
the sea,” cried Mother Mole, and her followers turned east. 
Varamyr might have been amongst them if only he’d been stronger. The sea was grey and cold 
and far away, though, and he knew that he would never live to see it. He was nine times dead and dying, 
and this would be his true death. A squirrel-skin cloak, he remembered, he knifed me for a squirrel-skin 
cloak. 
Its owner had been dead, the back of her head smashed into red pulp flecked with bits of bone, 
but her cloak looked warm and thick. It was snowing, and Varamyr had lost his own cloaks at the Wall. 
His sleeping pelts and woolen smallclothes, his sheepskin boots and fur-lined gloves, his store of mead 
and hoarded food, the hanks of hair he took from the women he bedded, even the golden arm rings 
Mance had given him, all lost and left behind. I burned and I died and then I ran, half-mad with pain and 
terror. The memory still shamed him, but he had not been alone. Others had run as well, hundreds of 
them, thousands. The battle was lost. The knights had come, invincible in their steel, killing everyone 
who stayed to fight. It was run or die. 

Death was not so easily outrun, however. So when Varamyr came upon the dead woman in the 
wood, he knelt to strip the cloak from her, and never saw the boy until he burst from hiding to drive the 
long bone knife into his side and rip the cloak out of his clutching fingers. “His mother,” Thistle told him 
later, after the boy had run off. “It were his mother’s cloak, and when he saw you robbing her …” 
“She was dead,” Varamyr said, wincing as her bone needle pierced his flesh. “Someone smashed 
her head. Some crow.” 
“No crow. Hornfoot men. I saw it.” Her needle pulled the gash in his side closed. “Savages, and 
who’s left to tame them?” No one. If Mance is dead, the free folk are doomed. The Thenns, giants, and 
the Hornfoot men, the cave-dwellers with their filed teeth, and the men of the western shore with their 
chariots of bone … all of them were doomed as well. Even the crows. They might not know it yet, but 
those black-cloaked bastards would perish with the rest. The enemy was coming. 
Haggon’s rough voice echoed in his head. “You will die a dozen deaths, boy, and every one will 
hurt … but when your true death comes, you will live again. The second life is simpler and sweeter, they 
say.” 
Varamyr Sixskins would know the truth of that soon enough. He could taste his true death in the 
smoke that hung acrid in the air, feel it in the heat beneath his fingers when he slipped a hand under his 
clothes to touch his wound. The chill was in him too, though, deep down in his bones. This time it would 
be cold that killed him. 
His last death had been by fire. I burned. At first, in his confusion, he thought some archer on 
the Wall had pierced him with a flaming arrow … but the fire had been inside him, consuming him. And 
the pain … 
Varamyr had died nine times before. He had died once from a spear thrust, once with a bear’s 
teeth in his throat, and once in a wash of blood as he brought forth a stillborn cub. He died his first 
death when he was only six, as his father’s axe crashed through his skull. Even that had not been so 
agonizing as the fire in his guts, crackling along his wings, devouring him. When he tried to fly from it, his 
terror fanned the flames and made them burn hotter. One moment he had been soaring above the 
Wall, his eagle’s eyes marking the movements of the men below. Then the flames had turned his heart 
into a blackened cinder and sent his spirit screaming back into his own skin, and for a little while he’d 
gone mad. Even the memory was enough to make him shudder. 
That was when he noticed that his fire had gone out. 
Only a grey-and-black tangle of charred wood remained, with a few embers glowing in the 
ashes. There’s still smoke, it just needs wood. Gritting his teeth against the pain, Varamyr crept to the 
pile of broken branches Thistle had gathered before she went off hunting, and tossed a few sticks onto 
the ashes. “Catch,” he croaked. “Burn.” He blew upon the embers and said a wordless prayer to the 
nameless gods of wood and hill and field. 

The gods gave no answer. After a while, the smoke ceased to rise as well. Already the little hut 
was growing colder. Varamyr had no flint, no tinder, no dry kindling. He would never get the fire burning 
again, not by himself. “Thistle,” he called out, his voice hoarse and edged with pain. “Thistle!” 
Her chin was pointed and her nose flat, and she had a mole on one cheek with four dark hairs 
growing from it. An ugly face, and hard, yet he would have given much to glimpse it in the door of the 
hut. I should have taken her before she left. How long had she been gone? Two days? Three? Varamyr 
was uncertain. It was dark inside the hut, and he had been drifting in and out of sleep, never quite sure 
if it was day or night outside. “Wait,” she’d said. “I will be back with food.” So like a fool he’d waited, 
dreaming of Haggon and Bump and all the wrongs he had done in his long life, but days and nights had 
passed and Thistle had not returned. She won’t be coming back. Varamyr wondered if he had given 
himself away. Could she tell what he was thinking just from looking at him, or had he muttered in his 
fever dream? 
Abomination, he heard Haggon saying. It was almost as if he were here, in this very room. “She 
is just some ugly spearwife,” Varamyr told him. “I am a great man. I am Varamyr, the warg, the 
skinchanger, it is not right that she should live and I should die.” No one answered. There was no one 
there. Thistle was gone. She had abandoned him, the same as all the rest. 
His own mother had abandoned him as well. She cried for Bump, but she never cried for me. The 
morning his father pulled him out of bed to deliver him to Haggon, she would not even look at him. He 
had shrieked and kicked as he was dragged into the woods, until his father slapped him and told him to 
be quiet. “You belong with your own kind,” was all he said when he flung him down at Haggon’s feet. 
He was not wrong, Varamyr thought, shivering. Haggon taught me much and more. He taught 
me how to hunt and fish, how to butcher a carcass and bone a fish, how to find my way through the 
woods. And he taught me the way of the warg and the secrets of the skinchanger, though my gift was 
stronger than his own. 
Years later he had tried to find his parents, to tell them that their Lump had become the great 
Varamyr Sixskins, but both of them were dead and burned. Gone into the trees and streams, gone into 
the rocks and earth. Gone to dirt and ashes. That was what the woods witch told his mother, the day 
Bump died. Lump did not want to be a clod of earth. The boy had dreamed of a day when bards would 
sing of his deeds and pretty girls would kiss him. When I am grown I will be the King-Beyond-the-Wall, 
Lump had promised himself. He never had, but he had come close. Varamyr Sixskins was a name men 
feared. He rode to battle on the back of a snow bear thirteen feet tall, kept three wolves and a 
shadowcat in thrall, and sat at the right hand of Mance Rayder. It was Mance who brought me to this 
place. I should not have listened. I should have slipped inside my bear and torn him to pieces. 
Before Mance, Varamyr Sixskins had been a lord of sorts. He lived alone in a hall of moss and 
mud and hewn logs that had once been Haggon’s, attended by his beasts. A dozen villages did him 
homage in bread and salt and cider, offering him fruit from their orchards and vegetables from their 
gardens. His meat he got himself. Whenever he desired a woman he sent his shadowcat to stalk her, and 
whatever girl he’d cast his eye upon would follow meekly to his bed. Some came weeping, aye, but still 

they came. Varamyr gave them his seed, took a hank of their hair to remember them by, and sent them 
back. From time to time, some village hero would come with spear in hand to slay the beastling and save 
a sister or a lover or a daughter. Those he killed, but he never harmed the women. Some he even 
blessed with children. Runts. Small, puny things, like Lump, and not one with the gift. 
Fear drove him to his feet, reeling. Holding his side to staunch the seep of blood from his 
wound, Varamyr lurched to the door and swept aside the ragged skin that covered it to face a wall of 
white. Snow. No wonder it had grown so dark and smoky inside. The falling snow had buried the hut. 
When Varamyr pushed at it, the snow crumbled and gave way, still soft and wet. Outside, the 
night was white as death; pale thin clouds danced attendance on a silver moon, while a thousand stars 
watched coldly. He could see the humped shapes of other huts buried beneath drifts of snow, and 
beyond them the pale shadow of a weirwood armored in ice. To the south and west the hills were a vast 
white wilderness where nothing moved except the blowing snow. “Thistle,” Varamyr called feebly, 
wondering how far she could have gone. “Thistle. Woman. Where are you?” 
Far away, a wolf gave howl. 
A shiver went through Varamyr. He knew that howl as well as Lump had once known his 
mother’s voice. One Eye. He was the oldest of his three, the biggest, the fiercest. Stalker was leaner, 
quicker, younger, Sly more cunning, but both went in fear of One Eye. The old wolf was fearless, 
relentless, savage. 
Varamyr had lost control of his other beasts in the agony of the eagle’s death. His shadowcat 
had raced into the woods, whilst his snow bear turned her claws on those around her, ripping apart four 
men before falling to a spear. She would have slain Varamyr had he come within her reach. The bear 
hated him, had raged each time he wore her skin or climbed upon her back. 
His wolves, though … 
My brothers. My pack. Many a cold night he had slept with his wolves, their shaggy bodies piled 
up around him to help keep him warm. When I die they will feast upon my flesh and leave only bones to 
greet the thaw come spring. The thought was queerly comforting. His wolves had often foraged for him 
as they roamed; it seemed only fitting that he should feed them in the end. He might well begin his 
second life tearing at the warm dead flesh of his own corpse. 
Dogs were the easiest beasts to bond with; they lived so close to men that they were almost 
human. Slipping into a dog’s skin was like putting on an old boot, its leather softened by wear. As a boot 
was shaped to accept a foot, a dog was shaped to accept a collar, even a collar no human eye could see. 
Wolves were harder. A man might befriend a wolf, even break a wolf, but no man could truly tame a 
wolf. “Wolves and women wed for life,” Haggon often said. “You take one, that’s a marriage. The wolf is 
part of you from that day on, and you’re part of him. Both of you will change.” 
Other beasts were best left alone, the hunter had declared. Cats were vain and cruel, always 
ready to turn on you. Elk and deer were prey; wear their skins too long, and even the bravest man 

became a coward. Bears, boars, badgers, weasels … Haggon did not hold with such. “Some skins you 
never want to wear, boy. You won’t like what you’d become.” Birds were the worst, to hear him tell it. 
“Men were not meant to leave the earth. Spend too much time in the clouds and you never want to 
come back down again. I know skinchangers who’ve tried hawks, owls, ravens. Even in their own skins, 
they sit moony, staring up at the bloody blue.” 
Not all skinchangers felt the same, however. Once, when Lump was ten, Haggon had taken him 
to a gathering of such. The wargs were the most numerous in that company, the wolf-brothers, but the 
boy had found the others stranger and more fascinating. Borroq looked so much like his boar that all he 
lacked was tusks, Orell had his eagle, Briar her shadowcat (the moment he saw them, Lump wanted a 
shadowcat of his own), the goat woman Grisella … 
None of them had been as strong as Varamyr Sixskins, though, not even Haggon, tall and grim 
with his hands as hard as stone. The hunter died weeping after Varamyr took Greyskin from him, driving 
him out to claim the beast for his own. No second life for you, old man. Varamyr Threeskins, he’d called 
himself back then. Greyskin made four, though the old wolf was frail and almost toothless and soon 
followed Haggon into death. 
Varamyr could take any beast he wanted, bend them to his will, make their flesh his own. Dog or 
wolf, bear or badger … 
Thistle, he thought. 
Haggon would call it an abomination, the blackest sin of all, but Haggon was dead, devoured, 
and burned. Mance would have cursed him as well, but Mance was slain or captured. No one will ever 
know. I will be Thistle the spearwife, and Varamyr Sixskins will be dead. His gift would perish with his 
body, he expected. He would lose his wolves, and live out the rest of his days as some scrawny, warty 
woman … but he would live. If she comes back. If I am still strong enough to take her. 
A wave of dizziness washed over Varamyr. He found himself upon his knees, his hands buried in 
a snowdrift. He scooped up a fistful of snow and filled his mouth with it, rubbing it through his beard 
and against his cracked lips, sucking down the moisture. The water was so cold that he could barely 
bring himself to swallow, and he realized once again how hot he was. 
The snowmelt only made him hungrier. It was food his belly craved, not water. The snow had 
stopped falling, but the wind was rising, filling the air with crystal, slashing at his face as he struggled 
through the drifts, the wound in his side opening and closing again. His breath made a ragged white 
cloud. When he reached the weirwood tree, he found a fallen branch just long enough to use as a 
crutch. Leaning heavily upon it, he staggered toward the nearest hut. Perhaps the villagers had 
forgotten something when they fled … a sack of apples, some dried meat, anything to keep him alive 
until Thistle returned. 
He was almost there when his crutch snapped beneath his weight, and his legs went out from 
under him. 

How long he sprawled there with his blood reddening the snow Varamyr could not have said. 
The snow will bury me. It would be a peaceful death. They say you feel warm near the end, warm and 
sleepy. It would be good to feel warm again, though it made him sad to think that he would never see 
the green lands, the warm lands beyond the Wall that Mance used to sing about. “The world beyond the 
Wall is not for our kind,” Haggon used to say. “The free folk fear skinchangers, but they honor us as well. 
South of the Wall, the kneelers hunt us down and butcher us like pigs.” 
You warned me, Varamyr thought, but it was you who showed me Eastwatch too. He could not 
have been more than ten. Haggon traded a dozen strings of amber and a sled piled high with pelts for six 
skins of wine, a block of salt, and a copper kettle. Eastwatch was a better place to trade than Castle 
Black; that was where the ships came, laden with goods from the fabled lands beyond the sea. The 
crows knew Haggon as a hunter and a friend to the Night’s Watch, and welcomed the news he brought 
of life beyond their Wall. Some knew him for a skinchanger too, but no one spoke of that. It was there at 
Eastwatch-by-the-Sea that the boy he’d been first began to dream of the warm south. 
Varamyr could feel the snowflakes melting on his brow. This is not so bad as burning. Let me 
sleep and never wake, let me begin my second life. His wolves were close now. He could feel them. He 
would leave this feeble flesh behind, become one with them, hunting the night and howling at the 
moon. The warg would become a true wolf. Which, though? 
Not Sly. Haggon would have called it abomination, but Varamyr had often slipped inside her skin 
as she was being mounted by One Eye. He did not want to spend his new life as a bitch, though, not 
unless he had no other choice. Stalker might suit him better, the younger male … though One Eye was 
larger and fiercer, and it was One Eye who took Sly whenever she went into heat. 
“They say you forget,” Haggon had told him, a few weeks before his own death. “When the 
man’s flesh dies, his spirit lives on inside the beast, but every day his memory fades, and the beast 
becomes a little less a warg, a little more a wolf, until nothing of the man is left and only the beast 
remains.” 
Varamyr knew the truth of that. When he claimed the eagle that had been Orell’s, he could feel 
the other skinchanger raging at his presence. Orell had been slain by the turncloak crow Jon Snow, and 
his hate for his killer had been so strong that Varamyr found himself hating the beastling boy as well. He 
had known what Snow was the moment he saw that great white direwolf stalking silent at his side. One 
skinchanger can always sense another. Mance should have let me take the direwolf. There would be a 
second life worthy of a king. He could have done it, he did not doubt. The gift was strong in Snow, but 
the youth was untaught, still fighting his nature when he should have gloried in it. 
Varamyr could see the weirwood’s red eyes staring down at him from the white trunk. The gods 
are weighing me. A shiver went through him. He had done bad things, terrible things. He had stolen, 
killed, raped. He had gorged on human flesh and lapped the blood of dying men as it gushed red and hot 
from their torn throats. He had stalked foes through the woods, fallen on them as they slept, clawed 
their entrails from their bellies and scattered them across the muddy earth. How sweet their meat had 
tasted. “That was the beast, not me,” he said in a hoarse whisper. “That was the gift you gave me.” 

The gods made no reply. His breath hung pale and misty in the air. He could feel ice forming in 
his beard. Varamyr Sixskins closed his eyes. 
He dreamt an old dream of a hovel by the sea, three dogs whimpering, a woman’s tears. 
Bump. She weeps for Bump, but she never wept for me. 
Lump had been born a month before his proper time, and he was sick so often that no one 
expected him to live. His mother waited until he was almost four to give him a proper name, and by 
then it was too late. The whole village had taken to calling him Lump, the name his sister Meha had 
given him when he was still in their mother’s belly. Meha had given Bump his name as well, but Lump’s 
little brother had been born in his proper time, big and red and robust, sucking greedily at Mother’s 
teats. She was going to name him after Father. Bump died, though. He died when he was two and I was 
six, three days before his nameday. 
“Your little one is with the gods now,” the woods witch told his mother, as she wept. “He’ll 
never hurt again, never hunger, never cry. The gods have taken him down into the earth, into the trees. 
The gods are all around us, in the rocks and streams, in the birds and beasts. Your Bump has gone to join 
them. He’ll be the world and all that’s in it.” 
The old woman’s words had gone through Lump like a knife. Bump sees. He is watching me. He 
knows. Lump could not hide from him, could not slip behind his mother’s skirts or run off with the dogs 
to escape his father’s fury. The dogs. Loptail, Sniff, the Growler. They were good dogs. They were my 
friends. 
When his father found the dogs sniffing round Bump’s body, he had no way of knowing which 
had done it, so he took his axe to all three. His hands shook so badly that it took two blows to silence 
Sniff and four to put the Growler down. The smell of blood hung heavy in the air, and the sounds the 
dying dogs had made were terrible to hear, yet Loptail still came when father called him. He was the 
oldest dog, and his training overcame his terror. By the time Lump slipped inside his skin it was too late. 
No, Father, please, he tried to say, but dogs cannot speak the tongues of men, so all that 
emerged was a piteous whine. The axe crashed into the middle of the old dog’s skull, and inside the 
hovel the boy let out a scream. That was how they knew. Two days later, his father dragged him into the 
woods. He brought his axe, so Lump thought he meant to put him down the same way he had done the 
dogs. Instead he’d given him to Haggon. 
Varamyr woke suddenly, violently, his whole body shaking. “Get up,” a voice was screaming, 
“get up, we have to go. There are hundreds of them.” The snow had covered him with a stiff white 
blanket. So cold. When he tried to move, he found that his hand was frozen to the ground. He left some 
skin behind when he tore it loose. “Get up,” she screamed again, “they’re coming.” 
Thistle had returned to him. She had him by the shoulders and was shaking him, shouting in his 
face. Varamyr could smell her breath and feel the warmth of it upon cheeks gone numb with cold. Now, 
he thought, do it now, or die. 

He summoned all the strength still in him, leapt out of his own skin, and forced himself inside 
her. 
Thistle arched her back and screamed. 
Abomination. Was that her, or him, or Haggon? He never knew. His old flesh fell back into the 
snowdrift as her fingers loosened. The spear-wife twisted violently, shrieking. His shadowcat used to 
fight him wildly, and the snow bear had gone half-mad for a time, snapping at trees and rocks and 
empty air, but this was worse. “Get out, get out!” he heard her own mouth shouting. Her body 
staggered, fell, and rose again, her hands flailed, her legs jerked this way and that in some grotesque 
dance as his spirit and her own fought for the flesh. She sucked down a mouthful of the frigid air, and 
Varamyr had half a heartbeat to glory in the taste of it and the strength of this young body before her 
teeth snapped together and filled his mouth with blood. She raised her hands to his face. He tried to 
push them down again, but the hands would not obey, and she was clawing at his eyes. Abomination, he 
remembered, drowning in blood and pain and madness. When he tried to scream, she spat their tongue 
out. 
The white world turned and fell away. For a moment it was as if he were inside the weirwood, 
gazing out through carved red eyes as a dying man twitched feebly on the ground and a madwoman 
danced blind and bloody underneath the moon, weeping red tears and ripping at her clothes. Then both 
were gone and he was rising, melting, his spirit borne on some cold wind. He was in the snow and in the 
clouds, he was a sparrow, a squirrel, an oak. A horned owl flew silently between his trees, hunting a 
hare; Varamyr was inside the owl, inside the hare, inside the trees. Deep below the frozen ground, 
earthworms burrowed blindly in the dark, and he was them as well. I am the wood, and everything 
that’s in it, he thought, exulting. A hundred ravens took to the air, cawing as they felt him pass. A great 
elk trumpeted, unsettling the children clinging to his back. A sleeping direwolf raised his head to snarl at 
empty air. Before their hearts could beat again he had passed on, searching for his own, for One Eye, Sly, 
and Stalker, for his pack. His wolves would save him, he told himself. 
That was his last thought as a man. 
True death came suddenly; he felt a shock of cold, as if he had been plunged into the icy waters 
of a frozen lake. Then he found himself rushing over moonlit snows with his packmates close behind 
him. Half the world was dark. One Eye, he knew. He bayed, and Sly and Stalker gave echo. 
When they reached the crest the wolves paused. Thistle, he remembered, and a part of him 
grieved for what he had lost and another part for what he’d done. Below, the world had turned to ice. 
Fingers of frost crept slowly up the weirwood, reaching out for each other. The empty village was no 
longer empty. Blue-eyed shadows walked amongst the mounds of snow. Some wore brown and some 
wore black and some were naked, their flesh gone white as snow. A wind was sighing through the hills, 
heavy with their scents: dead flesh, dry blood, skins that stank of mold and rot and urine. Sly gave a 
growl and bared her teeth, her ruff bristling. Not men. Not prey. Not these. 

The things below moved, but did not live. One by one, they raised their heads toward the three 
wolves on the hill. The last to look was the thing that had been Thistle. She wore wool and fur and 
leather, and over that she wore a coat of hoarfrost that crackled when she moved and glistened in the 
moonlight. Pale pink icicles hung from her fingertips, ten long knives of frozen blood. And in the pits 
where her eyes had been, a pale blue light was flickering, lending her coarse features an eerie beauty 
they had never known in life. 
She sees me. 
TYRION 
He drank his way across the narrow sea. 
The ship was small, his cabin smaller, but the captain would not allow him abovedecks. The 
rocking of the deck beneath his feet made his stomach heave, and the wretched food tasted even worse 
when retched back up. But why did he need salt beef, hard cheese, and bread crawling with worms 
when he had wine to nourish him? It was red and sour, very strong. Sometimes he heaved the wine up 
too, but there was always more. 
“The world is full of wine,” he muttered in the dankness of his cabin. His father never had any 
use for drunkards, but what did that matter? His father was dead. He’d killed him. A bolt in the belly, my 
lord, and all for you. If only I was better with a crossbow, I would have put it through that cock you made 
me with, you bloody bastard. 
Belowdecks, there was neither night nor day. Tyrion marked time by the comings and goings of 
the cabin boy who brought the meals he did not eat. The boy always brought a brush and bucket too, to 
clean up. “Is this Dornish wine?” Tyrion asked him once, as he pulled a stopper from a skin. “It reminds 
me of a certain snake I knew. A droll fellow, till a mountain fell on him.” 
The cabin boy did not answer. He was an ugly boy, though admittedly more comely than a 
certain dwarf with half a nose and a scar from eye to chin. “Have I offended you?” Tyrion asked, as the 
boy was scrubbing. “Were you commanded not to talk to me? Or did some dwarf diddle your mother?” 
That went unanswered too. “Where are we sailing? Tell me that.” Jaime had made mention of the Free 
Cities, but had never said which one. “Is it Braavos? Tyrosh? Myr?” Tyrion would sooner have gone to 
Dorne. Myrcella is older than Tommen, by Dornish law the Iron Throne is hers. I will help her claim her 
rights, as Prince Oberyn suggested. 
Oberyn was dead, though, his head smashed to bloody ruin by the armored fist of Ser Gregor 
Clegane. And without the Red Viper to urge him on, would Doran Martell even consider such a chancy 
scheme? He might clap me in chains instead and hand me back to my sweet sister. The Wall might be 
safer. Old Bear Mormont said the Night’s Watch had need of men like Tyrion. Mormont might be dead, 
though. By now Slynt may be the lord commander. That butcher’s son was not like to have forgotten 

who sent him to the Wall. Do I really want to spend the rest of my life eating salt beef and porridge with 
murderers and thieves? Not that the rest of his life would last very long. Janos Slynt would see to that. 
The cabin boy wet his brush and scrubbed on manfully. “Have you ever visited the pleasure 
houses of Lys?” the dwarf inquired. “Might that be where whores go?” Tyrion could not seem to recall 
the Valyrian word for whore, and in any case it was too late. The boy tossed his brush back in his bucket 
and took his leave. 
The wine has blurred my wits. He had learned to read High Valyrian at his maester’s knee, 
though what they spoke in the Nine Free Cities … well, it was not so much a dialect as nine dialects on 
the way to becoming separate tongues. Tyrion had some Braavosi and a smattering of Myrish. In Tyrosh 
he should be able to curse the gods, call a man a cheat, and order up an ale, thanks to a sellsword he 
had once known at the Rock. At least in Dorne they speak the Common Tongue. Like Dornish food and 
Dornish law, Dornish speech was spiced with the flavors of the Rhoyne, but a man could comprehend it. 
Dorne, yes, Dorne for me. He crawled into his bunk, clutching that thought like a child with a doll. 
Sleep had never come easily to Tyrion Lannister. Aboard that ship it seldom came at all, though 
from time to time he managed to drink sufficient wine to pass out for a while. At least he did not dream. 
He had dreamed enough for one small life. And of such follies: love, justice, friendship, glory. As well 
dream of being tall. It was all beyond his reach, Tyrion knew now. But he did not know where whores 
go. 
“Wherever whores go,” his father had said. His last words, and what words they were. The 
crossbow thrummed, Lord Tywin sat back down, and Tyrion Lannister found himself waddling through 
the darkness with Varys at his side. He must have clambered back down the shaft, two hundred and 
thirty rungs to where orange embers glowed in the mouth of an iron dragon. He remembered none of it. 
Only the sound the crossbow made, and the stink of his father’s bowels opening. Even in his dying, he 
found a way to shit on me. 
Varys had escorted him through the tunnels, but they never spoke until they emerged beside 
the Blackwater, where Tyrion had won a famous victory and lost a nose. That was when the dwarf 
turned to the eunuch and said, “I’ve killed my father,” in the same tone a man might use to say, “I’ve 
stubbed my toe.” 
The master of whisperers had been dressed as a begging brother, in a moth-eaten robe of 
brown roughspun with a cowl that shadowed his smooth fat cheeks and bald round head. “You should 
not have climbed that ladder,” he said reproachfully. 
“Wherever whores go.” Tyrion had warned his father not to say that word. If I had not loosed, he 
would have seen my threats were empty. He would have taken the crossbow from my hands, as once he 
took Tysha from my arms. He was rising when I killed him. 
“I killed Shae too,” he confessed to Varys. 
“You knew what she was.” 

“I did. But I never knew what he was.” 
Varys tittered. “And now you do.” 
I should have killed the eunuch as well. A little more blood on his hands, what would it matter? 
He could not say what had stayed his dagger. Not gratitude. Varys had saved him from a headsman’s 
sword, but only because Jaime had compelled him. Jaime … no, better not to think of Jaime. 
He found a fresh skin of wine instead and sucked at it as if it were a woman’s breast. The sour 
red ran down his chin and soaked through his soiled tunic, the same one he had been wearing in his cell. 
The deck was swaying beneath his feet, and when he tried to rise it lifted sideways and smashed him 
hard against a bulkhead. A storm, he realized, or else I am even drunker than I knew. He retched the 
wine up and lay in it a while, wondering if the ship would sink. Is this your vengeance, Father? Has the 
Father Above made you his Hand? “Such are the wages of the kinslayer,” he said as the wind howled 
outside. It did not seem fair to drown the cabin boy and the captain and all the rest for something he 
had done, but when had the gods ever been fair? And around about then, the darkness gulped him 
down. 
When he stirred again, his head felt like to burst and the ship was spinning round in dizzy circles, 
though the captain was insisting that they’d come to port. Tyrion told him to be quiet and kicked feebly 
as a huge bald sailor tucked him under one arm and carried him squirming to the hold, where an empty 
wine cask awaited him. It was a squat little cask, and a tight fit even for a dwarf. Tyrion pissed himself in 
his struggles, for all the good it did. He was crammed face-first into the cask with his knees pushed up 
against his ears. The stub of his nose itched horribly, but his arms were pinned so tightly that he could 
not reach to scratch it. A palanquin fit for a man of my stature, he thought as they hammered shut the 
lid. He could hear voices shouting as he was hoisted up. Every bounce cracked his head against the 
bottom of the cask. The world went round and round as the cask rolled downward, then stopped with a 
crash that made him want to scream. Another cask slammed into his, and Tyrion bit his tongue. 
That was the longest journey he had ever taken, though it could not have lasted more than half 
an hour. He was lifted and lowered, rolled and stacked, upended and righted and rolled again. Through 
the wooden staves he heard men shouting, and once a horse whickered nearby. His stunted legs began 
to cramp, and soon hurt so badly that he forgot the hammering in his head. 
It ended as it had begun, with another roll that left him dizzy and more jouncing. Outside, 
strange voices were speaking in a tongue he did not know. Someone started pounding on the top of the 
cask and the lid cracked open suddenly. Light came flooding in, and cool air as well. Tyrion gasped 
greedily and tried to stand, but only managed to knock the cask over sideways and spill himself out onto 
a hard-packed earthen floor. 
Above him loomed a grotesque fat man with a forked yellow beard, holding a wooden mallet 
and an iron chisel. His bedrobe was large enough to serve as a tourney pavilion, but its loosely knotted 
belt had come undone, exposing a huge white belly and a pair of heavy breasts that sagged like sacks of 

suet covered with coarse yellow hair. He reminded Tyrion of a dead sea cow that had once washed up in 
the caverns under Casterly Rock. 
The fat man looked down and smiled. “A drunken dwarf,” he said, in the Common Tongue of 
Westeros. 
“A rotting sea cow.” Tyrion’s mouth was full of blood. He spat it at the fat man’s feet. They were 
in a long, dim cellar with barrel-vaulted ceilings, its stone walls spotted with nitre. Casks of wine and ale 
surrounded them, more than enough drink to see a thirsty dwarf safely through the night. Or through a 
life. 
“You are insolent. I like that in a dwarf.” When the fat man laughed, his flesh bounced so 
vigorously that Tyrion was afraid he might fall and crush him. “Are you hungry, my little friend? Weary?” 
“Thirsty.” Tyrion struggled to his knees. “And filthy.” 
The fat man sniffed. “A bath first, just so. Then food and a soft bed, yes? My servants shall see 
to it.” His host put the mallet and chisel aside. “My house is yours. Any friend of my friend across the 
water is a friend to Illyrio Mopatis, yes.” 
And any friend of Varys the Spider is someone I will trust just as far as I can throw him. 
The fat man made good on the promised bath, though. No sooner did Tyrion lower himself into 
the hot water and close his eyes than he was fast asleep. He woke naked on a goose-down feather bed 
so soft it felt as if he had been swallowed by a cloud. His tongue was growing hair and his throat was 
raw, but his cock was as hard as an iron bar. He rolled from the bed, found a chamber pot, and 
commenced to filling it, with a groan of pleasure. 
The room was dim, but there were bars of yellow sunlight showing between the slats of the 
shutters. Tyrion shook the last drops off and waddled over patterned Myrish carpets as soft as new 
spring grass. Awkwardly he climbed the window seat and flung the shutters open to see where Varys 
and the gods had sent him. 
Beneath his window six cherry trees stood sentinel around a marble pool, their slender branches 
bare and brown. A naked boy stood on the water, poised to duel with a bravo’s blade in hand. He was 
lithe and handsome, no older than sixteen, with straight blond hair that brushed his shoulders. So 
lifelike did he seem that it took the dwarf a long moment to realize he was made of painted marble, 
though his sword shimmered like true steel. 
Across the pool stood a brick wall twelve feet high, with iron spikes along its top. Beyond that 
was the city. A sea of tiled rooftops crowded close around a bay. He saw square brick towers, a great red 
temple, a distant manse upon a hill. In the far distance, sunlight shimmered off deep water. Fishing 
boats were moving across the bay, their sails rippling in the wind, and he could see the masts of larger 
ships poking up along the shore. Surely one is bound for Dorne, or for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. He had no 

means to pay for passage, though, nor was he made to pull an oar. I suppose I could sign on as a cabin 
boy and earn my way by letting the crew bugger me up and down the narrow sea. 
He wondered where he was. Even the air smells different here. Strange spices scented the chilly 
autumn wind, and he could hear faint cries drifting over the wall from the streets beyond. It sounded 
something like Valyrian, but he did not recognize more than one word in five. Not Braavos, he 
concluded, nor Tyrosh. Those bare branches and the chill in the air argued against Lys and Myr and 
Volantis as well. 
When he heard the door opening behind him, Tyrion turned to confront his fat host. “This is 
Pentos, yes?” 
“Just so. Where else?” 
Pentos. Well, it was not King’s Landing, that much could be said for it. “Where do whores go?” 
he heard himself ask. 
“Whores are found in brothels here, as in Westeros. You will have no need of such, my little 
friend. Choose from amongst my servingwomen. None will dare refuse you.” 
“Slaves?” the dwarf asked pointedly. 
The fat man stroked one of the prongs of his oiled yellow beard, a gesture Tyrion found 
remarkably obscene. “Slavery is forbidden in Pentos, by the terms of the treaty the Braavosi imposed on 
us a hundred years ago. Still, they will not refuse you.” Illyrio gave a ponderous half bow. “But now my 
little friend must excuse me. I have the honor to be a magister of this great city, and the prince has 
summoned us to session.” He smiled, showing a mouth full of crooked yellow teeth. “Explore the manse 
and grounds as you like, but on no account stray beyond the walls. It is best that no man knows that you 
were here.” 
“Were? Have I gone somewhere?” 
“Time enough to speak of that this evening. My little friend and I shall eat and drink and make 
great plans, yes?” 
“Yes, my fat friend,” Tyrion replied. He thinks to use me for his profit. It was all profit with the 
merchant princes of the Free Cities. “Spice soldiers and cheese lords,” his lord father called them, with 
contempt. Should a day ever dawn when Illyrio Mopatis saw more profit in a dead dwarf than a live one, 
Tyrion would find himself packed into another wine cask by dusk. It would be well if I was gone before 
that day arrives. That it would arrive he did not doubt; Cersei was not like to forget him, and even Jaime 
might be vexed to find a quarrel in Father’s belly. 
A light wind was riffling the waters of the pool below, all around the naked swordsman. It 
reminded him of how Tysha would riffle his hair during the false spring of their marriage, before he 
helped his father’s guardsmen rape her. He had been thinking of those guardsmen during his flight, 

trying to recall how many there had been. You would think he might remember that, but no. A dozen? A 
score? A hundred? He could not say. They had all been grown men, tall and strong … though all men 
were tall to a dwarf of thirteen years. Tysha knew their number. Each of them had given her a silver stag, 
so she would only need to count the coins. A silver for each and a gold for me. His father had insisted 
that he pay her too. A Lannister always pays his debts. 
“Wherever whores go,” he heard Lord Tywin say once more, and once more the bowstring 
thrummed. 
The magister had invited him to explore the manse. He found clean clothes in a cedar chest 
inlaid with lapis and mother-of-pearl. The clothes had been made for a small boy, he realized as he 
struggled into them. The fabrics were rich enough, if a little musty, but the cut was too long in the legs 
and too short in the arms, with a collar that would have turned his face as black as Joffrey’s had he 
somehow contrived to get it fastened. Moths had been at them too. At least they do not stink of vomit. 
Tyrion began his explorations with the kitchen, where two fat women and a potboy watched 
him warily as he helped himself to cheese, bread, and figs. “Good morrow to you, fair ladies,” he said 
with a bow. “Do you know where whores go?” When they did not respond, he repeated the question in 
High Valyrian, though he had to say courtesan in place of whore. The younger, fatter cook gave him a 
shrug that time. 
He wondered what they would do if he took them by the hand and dragged them to his 
bedchamber. None will dare refuse you, Illyrio claimed, but somehow Tyrion did not think he meant 
these two. The younger woman was old enough to be his mother, and the older was likely her mother. 
Both were near as fat as Illyrio, with teats that were larger than his head. I could smother myself in flesh. 
There were worse ways to die. The way his lord father had died, for one. I should have made him shit a 
little gold before expiring. Lord Tywin might have been niggardly with his approval and affection, but he 
had always been open-handed when it came to coin. The only thing more pitiful than a dwarf without a 
nose is a dwarf without a nose who has no gold. 
Tyrion left the fat women to their loaves and kettles and went in search of the cellar where 
Illyrio had decanted him the night before. It was not hard to find. There was enough wine there to keep 
him drunk for a hundred years; sweet reds from the Reach and sour reds from Dorne, pale Pentoshi 
ambers, the green nectar of Myr, three score casks of Arbor gold, even wines from the fabled east, from 
Qarth and Yi Ti and Asshai by the Shadow. In the end, Tyrion chose a cask of strongwine marked as the 
private stock of Lord Runceford Redwyne, the grandfather of the present Lord of the Arbor. The taste of 
it was languorous and heady on the tongue, the color a purple so dark that it looked almost black in the 
dim-lit cellar. Tyrion filled a cup, and a flagon for good measure, and carried them up to the gardens to 
drink beneath those cherry trees he’d seen. 
As it happened, he left by the wrong door and never found the pool he had spied from his 
window, but it made no matter. The gardens behind the manse were just as pleasant, and far more 
extensive. He wandered through them for a time, drinking. The walls would have shamed any proper 
castle, and the ornamental iron spikes along the top looked strangely naked without heads to adorn 

them. Tyrion pictured how his sister’s head might look up there, with tar in her golden hair and flies 
buzzing in and out of her mouth. Yes, and Jaime must have the spike beside her, he decided. No one 
must ever come between my brother and my sister. 
With a rope and a grapnel he might be able to get over that wall. He had strong arms and he did 
not weigh much. He should be able to clamber over, if he did not impale himself on a spike. I will search 
for a rope on the morrow, he resolved. 
He saw three gates during his wanderings—the main entrance with its gatehouse, a postern by 
the kennels, and a garden gate hidden behind a tangle of pale ivy. The last was chained, the others 
guarded. The guards were plump, their faces as smooth as babies’ bottoms, and every man of them 
wore a spiked bronze cap. Tyrion knew eunuchs when he saw them. He knew their sort by reputation. 
They feared nothing and felt no pain, it was said, and were loyal to their masters unto death. I could 
make good use of a few hundred of mine own, he reflected. A pity I did not think of that before I became 
a beggar. 
He walked along a pillared gallery and through a pointed arch, and found himself in a tiled 
courtyard where a woman was washing clothes at a well. She looked to be his own age, with dull red 
hair and a broad face dotted by freckles. “Would you like some wine?” he asked her. She looked at him 
uncertainly. “I have no cup for you, we’ll have to share.” The wash-erwoman went back to wringing out 
tunics and hanging them to dry. Tyrion settled on a stone bench with his flagon. “Tell me, how far should 
I trust Magister Illyrio?” The name made her look up. “That far?” Chuckling, he crossed his stunted legs 
and took a drink. “I am loath to play whatever part the cheesemonger has in mind for me, yet how can I 
refuse him? The gates are guarded. Perhaps you might smuggle me out under your skirts? I’d be so 
grateful; why, I’ll even wed you. I have two wives already, why not three? Ah, but where would we 
live?” He gave her as pleasant a smile as a man with half a nose could manage. “I have a niece in 
Sunspear, did I tell you? I could make rather a lot of mischief in Dorne with Myrcella. I could set my 
niece and nephew at war, wouldn’t that be droll?” The washerwoman pinned up one of Illyrio’s tunics, 
large enough to double as a sail. “I should be ashamed to think such evil thoughts, you’re quite right. 
Better if I sought the Wall instead. All crimes are wiped clean when a man joins the Night’s Watch, they 
say. Though I fear they would not let me keep you, sweetling. No women in the Watch, no sweet freckly 
wives to warm your bed at night, only cold winds, salted cod, and small beer. Do you think I might stand 
taller in black, my lady?” He filled his cup again. “What do you say? North or south? Shall I atone for old 
sins or make some new ones?” 
The washerwoman gave him one last glance, picked up her basket, and walked away. I cannot 
seem to hold a wife for very long, Tyrion reflected. Somehow his flagon had gone dry. Perhaps I should 
stumble back down to the cellars. The strongwine was making his head spin, though, and the cellar steps 
were very steep. “Where do whores go?” he asked the wash flapping on the line. Perhaps he should 
have asked the washerwoman. Not to imply that you’re a whore, my dear, but perhaps you know where 
they go. Or better yet, he should have asked his father. “Wherever whores go,” Lord Tywin said. She 
loved me. She was a crofter’s daughter, she loved me and she wed me, she put her trust in me. 

The empty flagon slipped from his hand and rolled across the yard. Tyrion pushed himself off 
the bench and went to fetch it. As he did, he saw some mushrooms growing up from a cracked paving 
tile. Pale white they were, with speckles, and red-ribbed undersides dark as blood. The dwarf snapped 
one off and sniffed it. Delicious, he thought, and deadly. 
There were seven of the mushrooms. Perhaps the Seven were trying to tell him something. He 
picked them all, snatched a glove down from the line, wrapped them carefully, and stuffed them down 
his pocket. The effort made him dizzy, so afterward he crawled back onto the bench, curled up, and shut 
his eyes. 
When he woke again, he was back in his bedchamber, drowning in the goose-down feather bed 
once more while a blond girl shook his shoulder. “My lord,” she said, “your bath awaits. Magister Illyrio 
expects you at table within the hour.” 
Tyrion propped himself against the pillows, his head in his hands. “Do I dream, or do you speak 
the Common Tongue?” 
“Yes, my lord. I was bought to please the king.” She was blue-eyed and fair, young and willowy. 
“I am sure you did. I need a cup of wine.” 
She poured for him. “Magister Illyrio said that I am to scrub your back and warm your bed. My 
name—” 
“—is of no interest to me. Do you know where whores go?” She flushed. “Whores sell 
themselves for coin.” 
“Or jewels, or gowns, or castles. But where do they go?” 
The girl could not grasp the question. “Is it a riddle, m’lord? I’m no good at riddles. Will you tell 
me the answer?” 
No, he thought. I despise riddles, myself. “I will tell you nothing. Do me the same favor.” The only 
part of you that interests me is the part between your legs, he almost said. The words were on his 
tongue, but somehow never passed his lips. She is not Shae, the dwarf told himself, only some little fool 
who thinks I play at riddles. If truth be told, even her cunt did not interest him much. I must be sick, or 
dead. “You mentioned a bath? We must not keep the great cheesemonger waiting.” 
As he bathed, the girl washed his feet, scrubbed his back, and brushed his hair. Afterward she 
rubbed sweet-smelling ointment into his calves to ease the aches, and dressed him once again in boy’s 
clothing, a musty pair of burgundy breeches and a blue velvet doublet lined with cloth-of-gold. “Will my 
lord want me after he has eaten?” she asked as she was lacing up his boots. 
“No. I am done with women.” Whores. 

The girl took that disappointment too well for his liking. “If m’lord would prefer a boy, I can have 
one waiting in his bed.” 
M’lord would prefer his wife. M’lord would prefer a girl named Tysha. “Only if he knows where 
whores go.” 
The girl’s mouth tightened. She despises me, he realized, but no more than I despise myself. That 
he had fucked many a woman who loathed the very sight of him, Tyrion Lannister had no doubt, but the 
others had at least the grace to feign affection. A little honest loathing might be refreshing, like a tart 
wine after too much sweet. 
“I believe I have changed my mind,” he told her. “Wait for me abed. Naked, if you please, I’ll be 
a deal too drunk to fumble at your clothing. Keep your mouth shut and your thighs open and the two of 
us should get on splendidly.” He gave her a leer, hoping for a taste of fear, but all she gave him was 
revulsion. No one fears a dwarf. Even Lord Tywin had not been afraid, though Tyrion had held a 
crossbow in his hands. “Do you moan when you are being fucked?” he asked the bedwarmer. 
“If it please m’lord.” 
“It might please m’lord to strangle you. That’s how I served my last whore. Do you think your 
master would object? Surely not. He has a hundred more like you, but no one else like me.” This time, 
when he grinned, he got the fear he wanted. 
Illyrio was reclining on a padded couch, gobbling hot peppers and pearl onions from a wooden 
bowl. His brow was dotted with beads of sweat, his pig’s eyes shining above his fat cheeks. Jewels 
danced when he moved his hands; onyx and opal, tiger’s eye and tourmaline, ruby, amethyst, sapphire, 
emerald, jet and jade, a black diamond, and a green pearl. I could live for years on his rings, Tyrion 
mused, though I’d need a cleaver to claim them. 
“Come sit, my little friend.” Illyrio waved him closer. 
The dwarf clambered up onto a chair. It was much too big for him, a cushioned throne intended 
to accommodate the magister’s massive buttocks, with thick sturdy legs to bear his weight. Tyrion 
Lannister had lived all his life in a world that was too big for him, but in the manse of Illyrio Mopatis the 
sense of disproportion assumed grotesque dimensions. I am a mouse in a mammoth’s lair, he mused, 
though at least the mammoth keeps a good cellar. The thought made him thirsty. He called for wine. 
“Did you enjoy the girl I sent you?” Illyrio asked. “If I had wanted a girl I would have asked for 
one.” 
“If she failed to please …” 
“She did all that was required of her.” 
“I would hope so. She was trained in Lys, where they make an art of love. The king enjoyed her 
greatly.” 

“I kill kings, hadn’t you heard?” Tyrion smiled evilly over his wine cup. “I want no royal leavings.” 
“As you wish. Let us eat.” Illyrio clapped his hands together, and serving men came running. 
They began with a broth of crab and monkfish, and cold egg lime soup as well. Then came quails 
in honey, a saddle of lamb, goose livers drowned in wine, buttered parsnips, and suckling pig. The sight 
of it all made Tyrion feel queasy, but he forced himself to try a spoon of soup for the sake of politeness, 
and once he had tasted it he was lost. The cooks might be old and fat, but they knew their business. He 
had never eaten so well, even at court. 
As he was sucking the meat off the bones of his quail, he asked Illyrio about the morning’s 
summons. The fat man shrugged. “There are troubles in the east. Astapor has fallen, and Meereen. 
Ghiscari slave cities that were old when the world was young.” The suckling pig was carved. Illyrio 
reached for a piece of the crackling, dipped it in a plum sauce, and ate it with his fingers. 
“Slaver’s Bay is a long way from Pentos.” Tyrion speared a goose liver on the point of his knife. 
No man is as cursed as the kinslayer, he mused, but I could learn to like this hell. 
“This is so,” Illyrio agreed, “but the world is one great web, and a man dare not touch a single 
strand lest all the others tremble. More wine?” Illyrio popped a pepper into his mouth. “No, something 
better.” He clapped his hands together. 
At the sound a serving man entered with a covered dish. He placed it in front of Tyrion, and 
Illyrio leaned across the table to remove the lid. “Mushrooms,” the magister announced, as the smell 
wafted up. “Kissed with garlic and bathed in butter. I am told the taste is exquisite. Have one, my friend. 
Have two.” 
Tyrion had a fat black mushroom halfway to his mouth, but something in Illyrio’s voice made 
him stop abruptly. “After you, my lord.” He pushed the dish toward his host. 
“No, no.” Magister Illyrio pushed the mushrooms back. For a heartbeat it seemed as if a 
mischievous boy was peering out from inside the cheese-monger’s bloated flesh. “After you. I insist. 
Cook made them specially for you.” 
“Did she indeed?” He remembered the cook, the flour on her hands, heavy breasts shot through 
with dark blue veins. “That was kind of her, but … no.” Tyrion eased the mushroom back into the lake of 
butter from which it had emerged. 
“You are too suspicious.” Illyrio smiled through his forked yellow beard. Oiled every morning to 
make it gleam like gold, Tyrion suspected. “Are you craven? I had not heard that of you.” 
“In the Seven Kingdoms it is considered a grave breach of hospitality to poison your guest at 
supper.” 
“Here as well.” Illyrio Mopatis reached for his wine cup. “Yet when a guest plainly wishes to end 
his own life, why, his host must oblige him, no?” He took a gulp. “Magister Ordello was poisoned by a 

mushroom not half a year ago. The pain is not so much, I am told. Some cramping in the gut, a sudden 
ache behind the eyes, and it is done. Better a mushroom than a sword through your neck, is it not so? 
Why die with the taste of blood in your mouth when it could be butter and garlic?” 
The dwarf studied the dish before him. The smell of garlic and butter had his mouth watering. 
Some part of him wanted those mushrooms, even knowing what they were. He was not brave enough 
to take cold steel to his own belly, but a bite of mushroom would not be so hard. That frightened him 
more than he could say. “You mistake me,” he heard himself say. 
“Is it so? I wonder. If you would sooner drown in wine, say the word and it shall be done, and 
quickly. Drowning cup by cup wastes time and wine both.” 
“You mistake me,” Tyrion said again, more loudly. The buttered mushrooms glistened in the 
lamplight, dark and inviting. “I have no wish to die, I promise you. I have …” His voice trailed off into 
uncertainty. What do I have? A life to live? Work to do? Children to raise, lands to rule, a woman to love? 
“You have nothing,” finished Magister Illyrio, “but we can change that.” He plucked a mushroom 
from the butter, and chewed it lustily. “Delicious.” 
“The mushrooms are not poisoned.” Tyrion was irritated. 
“No. Why should I wish you ill?” Magister Illyrio ate another. “We must show a little trust, you 
and I. Come, eat.” He clapped his hands again. “We have work to do. My little friend must keep his 
strength up.” 
The serving men brought out a heron stuffed with figs, veal cutlets blanched with almond milk, 
creamed herring, candied onions, foul-smelling cheeses, plates of snails and sweetbreads, and a black 
swan in her plumage. Tyrion refused the swan, which reminded him of a supper with his sister. He 
helped himself to heron and herring, though, and a few of the sweet onions. And the serving men filled 
his wine cup anew each time he emptied it. 
“You drink a deal of wine for such a little man.” 
“Kinslaying is dry work. It gives a man a thirst.” 
The fat man’s eyes glittered like the gemstones on his fingers. “There are those in Westeros who 
would say that killing Lord Lannister was merely a good beginning.” 
“They had best not say it in my sister’s hearing, or they will find themselves short a tongue.” The 
dwarf tore a loaf of bread in half. “And you had best be careful what you say of my family, magister. 
Kinslayer or no, I am a lion still.” 
That seemed to amuse the lord of cheese no end. He slapped a meaty thigh and said, “You 
Westerosi are all the same. You sew some beast upon a scrap of silk, and suddenly you are all lions or 
dragons or eagles. I can take you to a real lion, my little friend. The prince keeps a pride in his 
menagerie. Would you like to share a cage with them?” 

The lords of the Seven Kingdoms did make rather much of their sigils, Tyrion had to admit. “Very 
well,” he conceded. “A Lannister is not a lion. Yet I am still my father’s son, and Jaime and Cersei are 
mine to kill.” 
“How odd that you should mention your fair sister,” said Illyrio, between snails. “The queen has 
offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head, no matter how humble his birth.” 
It was no more than Tyrion had expected. “If you mean to take her up on it, make her spread 
her legs for you as well. The best part of me for the best part of her, that’s a fair trade.” 
“I would sooner have mine own weight in gold.” The cheesemonger laughed so hard that Tyrion 
feared he was about to rupture. “All the gold in Casterly Rock, why not?” 
“The gold I grant you,” the dwarf said, relieved that he was not about to drown in a gout of 
half-digested eels and sweetmeats, “but the Rock is mine.” 
“Just so.” The magister covered his mouth and belched a mighty belch. “Do you think King 
Stannis will give it to you? I am told he is a great one for the law. Your brother wears the white cloak, so 
you are heir by all the laws of Westeros.” 
“Stannis might well grant me Casterly Rock,” said Tyrion, “but for the small matter of regicide 
and kinslaying. For those he would shorten me by a head, and I am short enough as I stand. But why 
would you think I mean to join Lord Stannis?” 
“Why else would you go the Wall?” 
“Stannis is at the Wall?” Tyrion rubbed at his nose. “What in seven bloody hells is Stannis doing 
at the Wall?” 
“Shivering, I would think. It is warmer down in Dorne. Perhaps he should have sailed that way.” 
Tyrion was beginning to suspect that a certain freckled washerwoman knew more of the 
Common Speech than she pretended. “My niece Myrcella is in Dorne, as it happens. And I have half a 
mind to make her a queen.” 
Illyrio smiled as his serving men spooned out bowls of black cherries in sweet cream for them 
both. “What has this poor child done to you that you would wish her dead?” 
“Even a kinslayer is not required to slay all his kin,” said Tyrion, wounded. “Queen her, I said. 
Not kill her.” 
The cheesemonger spooned up cherries. “In Volantis they use a coin with a crown on one face 
and a death’s-head on the other. Yet it is the same coin. To queen her is to kill her. Dorne might rise for 
Myrcella, but Dorne alone is not enough. If you are as clever as our friend insists, you know this.” 

Tyrion looked at the fat man with new interest. He is right on both counts. To queen her is to kill 
her. And I knew that. “Futile gestures are all that remain to me. This one would make my sister weep 
bitter tears, at least.” 
Magister Illyrio wiped sweet cream from his mouth with the back of a fat hand. “The road to 
Casterly Rock does not go through Dorne, my little friend. Nor does it run beneath the Wall. Yet there is 
such a road, I tell you.” 
“I am an attainted traitor, a regicide, and kinslayer.” This talk of roads annoyed him. Does he 
think this is a game? 
“What one king does, another may undo. In Pentos we have a prince, my friend. He presides at 
ball and feast and rides about the city in a palanquin of ivory and gold. Three heralds go before him with 
the golden scales of trade, the iron sword of war, and the silver scourge of justice. On the first day of 
each new year he must deflower the maid of the fields and the maid of the seas.” Illyrio leaned forward, 
elbows on the table. “Yet should a crop fail or a war be lost, we cut his throat to appease the gods and 
choose a new prince from amongst the forty families.” 
“Remind me never to become the Prince of Pentos.” 
“Are your Seven Kingdoms so different? There is no peace in Westeros, no justice, no faith … 
and soon enough, no food. When men are starving and sick of fear, they look for a savior.” 
“They may look, but if all they find is Stannis—” 
“Not Stannis. Nor Myrcella.” The yellow smile widened. “Another. Stronger than Tommen, 
gentler than Stannis, with a better claim than the girl Myrcella. A savior come from across the sea to 
bind up the wounds of bleeding Westeros.” 
“Fine words.” Tyrion was unimpressed. “Words are wind. Who is this bloody savior?” 
“A dragon.” The cheesemonger saw the look on his face at that, and laughed. “A dragon with 
three heads.” 
DAENERYS 
She could hear the dead man coming up the steps. The slow, measured sound of footsteps went 
before him, echoing amongst the purple pillars of her hall. Daenerys Targaryen awaited him upon the 
ebon bench that she had made her throne. Her eyes were soft with sleep, her silver-gold hair all tousled. 
“Your Grace,” said Ser Barristan Selmy, the lord commander of her Queensguard, “there is no 
need for you to see this.” 

“He died for me.” Dany clutched her lion pelt to her chest. Underneath, a sheer white linen tunic 
covered her to midthigh. She had been dreaming of a house with a red door when Missandei woke her. 
There had been no time to dress. 
“Khaleesi,” whispered Irri, “you must not touch the dead man. It is bad luck to touch the dead.” 
“Unless you killed them yourself.” Jhiqui was bigger-boned than Irri, with wide hips and heavy 
breasts. “That is known.” 
“It is known,” Irri agreed. 
Dothraki were wise where horses were concerned, but could be utter fools about much else. 
They are only girls, besides. Her handmaids were of an age with her—women grown to look at them, 
with their black hair, copper skin, and almond-shaped eyes, but girls all the same. They had been given 
to her when she wed Khal Drogo. It was Drogo who had given her the pelt she wore, the head and hide 
of a hrakkar, the white lion of the Dothraki sea. It was too big for her and had a musty smell, but it made 
her feel as if her sun-and-stars was still near her. 
Grey Worm appeared atop the steps first, a torch in hand. His bronze cap was crested with three 
spikes. Behind him followed four of his Unsullied, bearing the dead man on their shoulders. Their caps 
had only one spike each, and their faces showed so little they might have been cast of bronze as well. 
They laid the corpse down at her feet. Ser Barristan pulled back the bloodstained shroud. Grey Worm 
lowered the torch, so she might see. 
The dead man’s face was smooth and hairless, though his cheeks had been slashed open ear to 
ear. He had been a tall man, blue-eyed and fair of face. Some child of Lys or Old Volantis, snatched off a 
ship by corsairs and sold into bondage in red Astapor. Though his eyes were open, it was his wounds that 
wept. There were more wounds than she could count. 
“Your Grace,” Ser Barristan said, “there was a harpy drawn on the bricks in the alley where he 
was found …” 
“… drawn in blood.” Daenerys knew the way of it by now. The Sons of the Harpy did their 
butchery by night, and over each kill they left their mark. “Grey Worm, why was this man alone? Had he 
no partner?” By her command, when the Unsullied walked the streets of Meereen by night they always 
walked in pairs. 
“My queen,” replied the captain, “your servant Stalwart Shield had no duty last night. He had 
gone to a … a certain place … to drink, and have companionship.” 
“A certain place? What do you mean?” 
“A house of pleasure, Your Grace.” 
A brothel. Half of her freedmen were from Yunkai, where the Wise Masters had been famed for 
training bedslaves. The way of the seven sighs. Brothels had sprouted up like mushrooms all over 

Meereen. It is all they know. They need to survive. Food was more costly every day, whilst the price of 
flesh grew cheaper. In the poorer districts between the stepped pyramids of Meereen’s slaver nobility, 
there were brothels catering to every conceivable erotic taste, she knew. Even so … “What could a 
eunuch hope to find in a brothel?” 
“Even those who lack a man’s parts may still have a man’s heart, Your Grace,” said Grey Worm. 
“This one has been told that your servant Stalwart Shield sometimes gave coin to the women of the 
brothels to lie with him and hold him.” 
The blood of the dragon does not weep. “Stalwart Shield,” she said, dry-eyed. “That was his 
name?” 
“If it please Your Grace.” 
“It is a fine name.” The Good Masters of Astapor had not allowed their slave soldiers even 
names. Some of her Unsullied reclaimed their birth names after she had freed them; others chose new 
names for themselves. “Is it known how many attackers fell upon Stalwart Shield?” 
“This one does not know. Many.” 
“Six or more,” said Ser Barristan. “From the look of his wounds, they swarmed him from all 
sides. He was found with an empty scabbard. It may be that he wounded some of his attackers.” 
Dany said a silent prayer that somewhere one of the Harpy’s Sons was dying even now, 
clutching at his belly and writhing in pain. “Why did they cut open his cheeks like that?” 
“Gracious queen,” said Grey Worm, “his killers had forced the genitals of a goat down the throat 
of your servant Stalwart Shield. This one removed them before bringing him here.” 
They could not feed him his own genitals. The Astapori left him neither root nor stem. “The Sons 
grow bolder,” Dany observed. Until now, they had limited their attacks to unarmed freedmen, cutting 
them down in the streets or breaking into their homes under the cover of darkness to murder them in 
their beds. “This is the first of my soldiers they have slain.” 
“The first,” Ser Barristan warned, “but not the last.” 
I am still at war, Dany realized, only now I am fighting shadows. She had hoped for a respite 
from the killing, for some time to build and heal. 
Shrugging off the lion pelt, she knelt beside the corpse and closed the dead man’s eyes, ignoring 
Jhiqui’s gasp. “Stalwart Shield shall not be forgotten. Have him washed and dressed for battle and bury 
him with cap and shield and spears.” 
“It shall be as Your Grace commands,” said Grey Worm. 
“Send men to the Temple of the Graces and ask if any man has come to the Blue Graces with a 
sword wound. And spread the word that we will pay good gold for the short sword of Stalwart Shield. 

Inquire of the butchers and the herdsmen, and learn who has been gelding goats of late.” Perhaps some 
goatherd would confess. “Henceforth, no man of mine walks alone after dark.” 
“These ones shall obey.” 
Daenerys pushed her hair back. “Find these cowards for me. Find them, so that I might teach the 
Harpy’s Sons what it means to wake the dragon.” 
Grey Worm saluted her. His Unsullied closed the shroud once more, lifted the dead man onto 
their shoulders, and bore him from the hall. Ser Barristan Selmy remained behind. His hair was white, 
and there were crow’s-feet at the corners of his pale blue eyes. Yet his back was still un-bent, and the 
years had not yet robbed him of his skill at arms. “Your Grace,” he said, “I fear your eunuchs are ill 
suited for the tasks you set them.” 
Dany settled on her bench and wrapped her pelt about her shoulders once again. “The Unsullied 
are my finest warriors.” 
“Soldiers, not warriors, if it please Your Grace. They were made for the battlefield, to stand 
shoulder to shoulder behind their shields with their spears thrust out before them. Their training 
teaches them to obey, fearlessly, perfectly, without thought or hesitation … not to unravel secrets or ask 
questions.” 
“Would knights serve me any better?” Selmy was training knights for her, teaching the sons of 
slaves to fight with lance and longsword in the Westerosi fashion … but what good would lances do 
against cowards who killed from the shadows? 
“Not in this,” the old man admitted. “And Your Grace has no knights, save me. It will be years 
before the boys are ready.” 
“Then who, if not Unsullied? Dothraki would be even worse.” Dothraki fought from horseback. 
Mounted men were of more use in open fields and hills than in the narrow streets and alleys of the city. 
Beyond Meereen’s walls of many-colored brick, Dany’s rule was tenuous at best. Thousands of slaves 
still toiled on vast estates in the hills, growing wheat and olives, herding sheep and goats, and mining 
salt and copper. Meereen’s storehouses held ample supplies of grain, oil, olives, dried fruit, and salted 
meat, but the stores were dwindling. So Dany had dispatched her tiny khalasar to subdue the 
hinterlands, under the command of her three bloodriders, whilst Brown Ben Plumm took his Second 
Sons south to guard against Yunkish incursions. 
The most crucial task of all she had entrusted to Daario Naharis, glib-tongued Daario with his 
gold tooth and trident beard, smiling his wicked smile through purple whiskers. Beyond the eastern hills 
was a range of rounded sandstone mountains, the Khyzai Pass, and Lhazar. If Daario could convince the 
Lhazarene to reopen the overland trade routes, grains could be brought down the river or over the hills 
at need … but the Lamb Men had no reason to love Meereen. “When the Stormcrows return from 
Lhazar, perhaps I can use them in the streets,” she told Ser Barristan, “but until then I have only the 
Unsullied.” Dany rose. “You must excuse me, ser. The petitioners will soon be at my gates. I must don 

my floppy ears and become their queen again. Summon Reznak and the Shavepate, I’ll see them when 
I’m dressed.” 
“As Your Grace commands.” Selmy bowed. 
The Great Pyramid shouldered eight hundred feet into the sky, from its huge square base to the 
lofty apex where the queen kept her private chambers, surrounded by greenery and fragrant pools. As a 
cool blue dawn broke over the city, Dany walked out onto the terrace. To the west sunlight blazed off 
the golden domes of the Temple of the Graces, and etched deep shadows behind the stepped pyramids 
of the mighty. In some of those pyramids, the Sons of the Harpy are plotting new murders even now, and 
I am powerless to stop them. 
Viserion sensed her disquiet. The white dragon lay coiled around a pear tree, his head resting on 
his tail. When Dany passed his eyes came open, two pools of molten gold. His horns were gold as well, 
and the scales that ran down his back from head to tail. “You’re lazy,” she told him, scratching under his 
jaw. His scales were hot to the touch, like armor left too long in the sun. Dragons are fire made flesh. 
She had read that in one of the books Ser Jorah had given her as a wedding gift. “You should be hunting 
with your brothers. Have you and Drogon been fighting again?” Her dragons were growing wild of late. 
Rhaegal had snapped at Irri, and Viserion had set Reznak’s tokar ablaze the last time the seneschal had 
called. I have left them too much to themselves, but where am I to find the time for them? 
Viserion’s tail lashed sideways, thumping the trunk of the tree so hard that a pear came 
tumbling down to land at Dany’s feet. His wings unfolded, and he half flew, half hopped onto the 
parapet. He grows, she thought as he launched himself into the sky. They are all three growing. Soon 
they will be large enough to bear my weight. Then she would fly as Aegon the Conqueror had flown, up 
and up, until Meereen was so small that she could blot it out with her thumb. 
She watched Viserion climb in widening circles until he was lost to sight beyond the muddy 
waters of the Skahazadhan. Only then did Dany go back inside the pyramid, where Irri and Jhiqui were 
waiting to brush the tangles from her hair and garb her as befit the Queen of Meereen, in a Ghiscari 
tokar. 
The garment was a clumsy thing, a long loose shapeless sheet that had to be wound around her 
hips and under an arm and over a shoulder, its dangling fringes carefully layered and displayed. Wound 
too loose, it was like to fall off; wound too tight, it would tangle, trip, and bind. Even wound properly, 
the tokar required its wearer to hold it in place with the left hand. Walking in a tokar demanded small, 
mincing steps and exquisite balance, lest one tread upon those heavy trailing fringes. It was not a 
garment meant for any man who had to work. The tokar was a master’s garment, a sign of wealth and 
power. 
Dany had wanted to ban the tokar when she took Meereen, but her advisors had convinced her 
otherwise. “The Mother of Dragons must don the tokar or be forever hated,” warned the Green Grace, 
Galazza Galare. “In the wools of Westeros or a gown of Myrish lace, Your Radiance shall forever remain 
a stranger amongst us, a grotesque outlander, a barbarian conqueror. Meereen’s queen must be a lady 

of Old Ghis.” Brown Ben Plumm, the captain of the Second Sons, had put it more succinctly. “Man wants 
to be the king o’ the rabbits, he best wear a pair o’ floppy ears.” 
The floppy ears she chose today were made of sheer white linen, with a fringe of golden tassels. 
With Jhiqui’s help, she wound the tokar about herself correctly on her third attempt. Irri fetched her 
crown, wrought in the shape of the three-headed dragon of her House. Its coils were gold, its wings 
silver, its three heads ivory, onyx, and jade. Dany’s neck and shoulders would be stiff and sore from the 
weight of it before the day was done. A crown should not sit easy on the head. One of her royal 
forebears had said that, once. Some Aegon, but which one? Five Aegons had ruled the Seven Kingdoms 
of Westeros. There would have been a sixth, but the Usurper’s dogs had murdered her brother’s son 
when he was still a babe at the breast. If he had lived, I might have married him. Aegon would have been 
closer to my age than Viserys. Dany had only been conceived when Aegon and his sister were murdered. 
Their father, her brother Rhaegar, perished even earlier, slain by the Usurper on the Trident. Her 
brother Viserys had died screaming in Vaes Dothrak with a crown of molten gold upon his head. They 
will kill me too if I allow it. The knives that slew my Stalwart Shield were meant for me. 
She had not forgotten the slave children the Great Masters had nailed up along the road from 
Yunkai. They had numbered one hundred sixty-three, a child every mile, nailed to mileposts with one 
arm outstretched to point her way. After Meereen had fallen, Dany had nailed up a like number of Great 
Masters. Swarms of flies had attended their slow dying, and the stench had lingered long in the plaza. 
Yet some days she feared that she had not gone far enough. These Meereenese were a sly and stubborn 
people who resisted her at every turn. They had freed their slaves, yes … only to hire them back as 
servants at wages so meagre that most could scarce afford to eat. Those too old or young to be of use 
had been cast into the streets, along with the infirm and the crippled. And still the Great Masters 
gathered atop their lofty pyramids to complain of how the dragon queen had filled their noble city with 
hordes of unwashed beggars, thieves, and whores. 
To rule Meereen I must win the Meereenese, however much I may despise them. “I am ready,” 
she told Irri. 
Reznak and Skahaz waited atop the marble steps. “Great queen,” declared Reznak mo Reznak, 
“you are so radiant today I fear to look on you.” The seneschal wore a tokar of maroon silk with a golden 
fringe. A small, damp man, he smelled as if he had bathed in perfume and spoke a bastard form of High 
Valyrian, much corrupted and flavored with a thick Ghiscari growl. 
“You are kind to say so,” Dany answered, in the same tongue. 
“My queen,” growled Skahaz mo Kandaq, of the shaven head. Ghiscari hair was dense and wiry; 
it had long been the fashion for the men of the Slaver Cities to tease it into horns and spikes and wings. 
By shaving, Skahaz had put old Meereen behind him to accept the new, and his kin had done the same 
after his example. Others followed, though whether from fear, fashion, or ambition, Dany could not say; 
shavepates, they were called. Skahaz was the Shavepate … and the vilest of traitors to the Sons of the 
Harpy and their ilk. “We were told about the eunuch.” 

“His name was Stalwart Shield.” 
“More will die unless the murderers are punished.” Even with his shaven scalp, Skahaz had an 
odious face—a beetled brow, small eyes with heavy bags beneath them, a big nose dark with 
blackheads, oily skin that looked more yellow than the usual amber of Ghiscari. It was a blunt, brutal, 
angry face. She could only pray it was an honest one as well. 
“How can I punish them when I do not know who they are?” Dany demanded of him. “Tell me 
that, bold Skahaz.” 
“You have no lack of enemies, Your Grace. You can see their pyramids from your terrace. Zhak, 
Hazkar, Ghazeen, Merreq, Loraq, all the old slaving families. Pahl. Pahl, most of all. A house of women 
now. Bitter old women with a taste for blood. Women do not forget. Women do not forgive.” 
No, Dany thought, and the Usurper’s dogs will learn that, when I return to Westeros. It was true 
that there was blood between her and the House of Pahl. Oznak zo Pahl had been cut down by Strong 
Belwas in single combat. His father, commander of Meereen’s city watch, had died defending the gates 
when Joso’s Cock smashed them into splinters. Three uncles had been among the hundred sixty-three 
on the plaza. “How much gold have we offered for information concerning the Sons of the Harpy?” Dany 
asked. 
“One hundred honors, if it please Your Radiance.” 
“One thousand honors would please us more. Make it so.” 
“Your Grace has not asked for my counsel,” said Skahaz Shavepate, “but I say that blood must 
pay for blood. Take one man from each of the families I have named and kill him. The next time one of 
yours is slain, take two from each great House and kill them both. There will not be a third murder.” 
Reznak squealed in distress. “Noooo … gentle queen, such savagery would bring down the ire of 
the gods. We will find the murderers, I promise you, and when we do they will prove to be baseborn 
filth, you shall see.” 
The seneschal was as bald as Skahaz, though in his case the gods were responsible. “Should any 
hair be so insolent as to appear, my barber stands with razor ready,” he had assured her when she 
raised him up. There were times when Dany wondered if that razor might not be better saved for 
Reznak’s throat. He was a useful man, but she liked him little and trusted him less. The Undying of Qarth 
had told her she would be thrice betrayed. Mirri Maz Duur had been the first, Ser Jorah the second. 
Would Reznak be the third? The Shavepate? Daario? Or will it be someone I would never suspect, Ser 
Barristan or Grey Worm or Missandei? 
“Skahaz,” she told the Shavepate, “I thank you for your counsel. Reznak, see what one thousand 
honors may accomplish.” Clutching her tokar, Daenerys swept past them down the broad marble stair. 
She took one step at a time, lest she trip over her fringe and go tumbling headfirst into court. 

Missandei announced her. The little scribe had a sweet, strong voice. “All kneel for Daenerys 
Stormborn, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, 
Khaleesi of Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Shackles, and Mother of Dragons.” 
The hall had filled. Unsullied stood with their backs to the pillars, holding shields and spears, the 
spikes on their caps jutting upward like a row of knives. The Meereenese had gathered beneath the 
eastern windows. Her freedmen stood well apart from their former masters. Until they stand together, 
Meereen will know no peace. “Arise.” Dany settled onto her bench. The hall rose. That at least they do 
as one. 
Reznak mo Reznak had a list. Custom demanded that the queen begin with the Astapori envoy, 
a former slave who called himself Lord Ghael, though no one seemed to know what he was lord of. 
Lord Ghael had a mouth of brown and rotten teeth and the pointed yellow face of a weasel. He 
also had a gift. “Cleon the Great sends these slippers as a token of his love for Daenerys Stormborn, the 
Mother of Dragons.” 
Irri slid the slippers onto Dany’s feet. They were gilded leather, decorated with green freshwater 
pearls. Does the butcher king believe a pair of pretty slippers will win my hand? “King Cleon is most 
generous. You may thank him for his lovely gift.” Lovely, but made for a child. Dany had small feet, yet 
the pointed slippers mashed her toes together. 
“Great Cleon will be pleased to know they pleased you,” said Lord Ghael. “His Magnificence bids 
me say that he stands ready to defend the Mother of Dragons from all her foes.” 
If he proposes again that I wed King Cleon, I’ll throw a slipper at his head, Dany thought, but for 
once the Astapori envoy made no mention of a royal marriage. Instead he said, “The time has come for 
Astapor and Meereen to end the savage reign of the Wise Masters of Yunkai, who are sworn foes to all 
those who live in freedom. Great Cleon bids me tell you that he and his new Unsullied will soon march.” 
His new Unsullied are an obscene jape. “King Cleon would be wise to tend his own gardens and 
let the Yunkai’i tend theirs.” It was not that Dany harbored any love for Yunkai. She was coming to 
regret leaving the Yellow City untaken after defeating its army in the field. The Wise Masters had 
returned to slaving as soon as she moved on, and were busy raising levies, hiring sellswords, and making 
alliances against her. 
Cleon the self-styled Great was no better, however. The Butcher King had restored slavery to 
Astapor, the only change being that the former slaves were now the masters and the former masters 
were now the slaves. 
“I am only a young girl and know little of the ways of war,” she told Lord Ghael, “but we have 
heard that Astapor is starving. Let King Cleon feed his people before he leads them out to battle.” She 
made a gesture of dismissal. Ghael withdrew. 
“Magnificence,” prompted Reznak mo Reznak, “will you hear the noble Hizdahr zo Loraq?” 

Again? Dany nodded, and Hizdahr strode forth; a tall man, very slender, with flawless amber 
skin. He bowed on the same spot where Stalwart Shield had lain in death not long before. I need this 
man, Dany reminded herself. Hizdahr was a wealthy merchant with many friends in Meereen, and more 
across the seas. He had visited Volantis, Lys, and Qarth, had kin in Tolos and Elyria, and was even said to 
wield some influence in New Ghis, where the Yunkai’i were trying to stir up enmity against Dany and her 
rule. 
And he was rich. Famously and fabulously rich … 
And like to grow richer, if I grant his petition. When Dany had closed the city’s fighting pits, the 
value of pit shares had plummeted. Hizdahr zo Loraq had grabbed them up with both hands, and now 
owned most of the fighting pits in Meereen. 
The nobleman had wings of wiry red-black hair sprouting from his temples. They made him look 
as if his head were about to take flight. His long face was made even longer by a beard bound with rings 
of gold. His purple tokar was fringed with amethysts and pearls. “Your Radiance will know the reason I 
am here.” 
“Why, it must be because you have no other purpose but to plague me. How many times have I 
refused you?” 
“Five times, Your Magnificence.” 
“Six now. I will not have the fighting pits reopened.” 
“If Your Majesty will hear my arguments …” 
“I have. Five times. Have you brought new arguments?” 
“Old arguments,” Hizdahr admitted, “new words. Lovely words, and courteous, more apt to 
move a queen.” 
“It is your cause I find wanting, not your courtesies. I have heard your arguments so often I 
could plead your case myself. Shall I?” Dany leaned forward. “The fighting pits have been a part of 
Meereen since the city was founded. The combats are profoundly religious in nature, a blood sacrifice to 
the gods of Ghis. The mortal art of Ghis is not mere butchery but a display of courage, skill, and strength 
most pleasing to your gods. Victorious fighters are pampered and acclaimed, and the slain are honored 
and remembered. By reopening the pits I would show the people of Meereen that I respect their ways 
and customs. The pits are far-famed across the world. They draw trade to Meereen, and fill the city’s 
coffers with coin from the ends of the earth. All men share a taste for blood, a taste the pits help slake. 
In that way they make Meereen more tranquil. For criminals condemned to die upon the sands, the pits 
represent a judgment by battle, a last chance for a man to prove his innocence.” She leaned back again, 
with a toss of her head. “There. How have I done?” 

“Your Radiance has stated the case much better than I could have hoped to do myself. I see that 
you are eloquent as well as beautiful. I am quite persuaded.” 
She had to laugh. “Ah, but I am not.” 
“Your Magnificence,” whispered Reznak mo Reznak in her ear, “it is customary for the city to 
claim one-tenth of all the profits from the fighting pits, after expenses, as a tax. That coin might be put 
to many noble uses.” 
“It might … though if we were to reopen the pits, we should take our tenth before expenses. I 
am only a young girl and know little of such matters, but I dwelt with Xaro Xhoan Daxos long enough to 
learn that much. 
Hizdahr, if you could marshal armies as you marshal arguments, you could conquer the world … 
but my answer is still no. For the sixth time.” 
“The queen has spoken.” He bowed again, as deeply as before. His pearls and amethysts 
clattered softly against the marble floor. A very limber man was Hizdahr zo Loraq. 
He might be handsome, but for that silly hair. Reznak and the Green Grace had been urging 
Dany to take a Meereenese noble for her husband, to reconcile the city to her rule. Hizdahr zo Loraq 
might be worth a careful look. Sooner him than Skahaz. The Shavepate had offered to set aside his wife 
for her, but the notion made her shudder. Hizdahr at least knew how to smile. 
“Magnificence,” said Reznak, consulting his list, “the noble Grazdan zo Galare would address 
you. Will you hear him?” 
“It would be my pleasure,” said Dany, admiring the glimmer of the gold and the sheen of the 
green pearls on Cleon’s slippers while doing her best to ignore the pinching in her toes. Grazdan, she 
had been forewarned, was a cousin of the Green Grace, whose support she had found invaluable. The 
priestess was a voice for peace, acceptance, and obedience to lawful authority. I can give her cousin a 
respectful hearing, whatever he desires. 
What he desired turned out to be gold. Dany had refused to compensate any of the Great 
Masters for the value of their slaves, but the Meereenese kept devising other ways to squeeze coin from 
her. The noble Grazdan had once owned a slave woman who was a very fine weaver, it seemed; the 
fruits of her loom were greatly valued, not only in Meereen, but in New Ghis and Astapor and Qarth. 
When this woman had grown old, Grazdan had purchased half a dozen young girls and commanded the 
crone to instruct them in the secrets of her craft. The old woman was dead now. The young ones, freed, 
had opened a shop by the harbor wall to sell their weavings. Grazdan zo Galare asked that he be granted 
a portion of their earnings. “They owe their skill to me,” he insisted. “I plucked them from the auction 
bloc and gave them to the loom.” 
Dany listened quietly, her face still. When he was done, she said, “What was the name of the old 
weaver?” 

“The slave?” Grazdan shifted his weight, frowning. “She was … Elza, it might have been. Or Ella. 
It was six years ago she died. I have owned so many slaves, Your Grace.” 
“Let us say Elza. Here is our ruling. From the girls, you shall have nothing. It was Elza who taught 
them weaving, not you. From you, the girls shall have a new loom, the finest coin can buy. That is for 
forgetting the name of the old woman.” 
Reznak would have summoned another tokar next, but Dany insisted that he call upon a 
freedman. Thereafter she alternated between the former masters and the former slaves. Many and 
more of the matters brought before her involved redress. Meereen had been sacked savagely after its 
fall. The stepped pyramids of the mighty had been spared the worst of the ravages, but the humbler 
parts of the city had been given over to an orgy of looting and killing as the city’s slaves rose up and the 
starving hordes who had followed her from Yunkai and Astapor poured through the broken gates. Her 
Unsullied had finally restored order, but the sack left a plague of problems in its wake. And so they came 
to see the queen. 
A rich woman came, whose husband and sons had died defending the city walls. During the sack 
she had fled to her brother in fear. When she returned, she found her house had been turned into a 
brothel. The whores had bedecked themselves in her jewels and clothes. She wanted her house back, 
and her jewels. “They can keep the clothes,” she allowed. Dany granted her the jewels but ruled the 
house was lost when she abandoned it. 
A former slave came, to accuse a certain noble of the Zhak. The man had recently taken to wife 
a freedwoman who had been the noble’s bed-warmer before the city fell. The noble had taken her 
maidenhood, used her for his pleasure, and gotten her with child. Her new husband wanted the noble 
gelded for the crime of rape, and he wanted a purse of gold as well, to pay him for raising the noble’s 
bastard as his own. Dany granted him the gold, but not the gelding. “When he lay with her, your wife 
was his property, to do with as he would. By law, there was no rape.” Her decision did not please him, 
she could see, but if she gelded every man who ever forced a bedslave, she would soon rule a city of 
eunuchs. 
A boy came, younger than Dany, slight and scarred, dressed up in a frayed grey tokar trailing 
silver fringe. His voice broke when he told of how two of his father’s household slaves had risen up the 
night the gate broke. One had slain his father, the other his elder brother. Both had raped his mother 
before killing her as well. The boy had escaped with no more than the scar upon his face, but one of the 
murderers was still living in his father’s house, and the other had joined the queen’s soldiers as one of 
the Mother’s Men. He wanted them both hanged. 
I am queen over a city built on dust and death. Dany had no choice but to deny him. She had 
declared a blanket pardon for all crimes committed during the sack. Nor would she punish slaves for 
rising up against their masters. 
When she told him, the boy rushed at her, but his feet tangled in his tokar and he went 
sprawling headlong on the purple marble. Strong Belwas was on him at once. The huge brown eunuch 

yanked him up one-handed and shook him like a mastiff with a rat. “Enough, Belwas,” Dany called. 
“Release him.” To the boy she said, “Treasure that tokar, for it saved your life. You are only a boy, so we 
will forget what happened here. You should do the same.” But as he left the boy looked back over his 
shoulder, and when she saw his eyes Dany thought, The Harpy has another Son. 
By midday Daenerys was feeling the weight of the crown upon her head, and the hardness of 
the bench beneath her. With so many still waiting on her pleasure, she did not stop to eat. Instead she 
dispatched Jhiqui to the kitchens for a platter of flatbread, olives, figs, and cheese. She nibbled whilst 
she listened, and sipped from a cup of watered wine. The figs were fine, the olives even finer, but the 
wine left a tart metallic aftertaste in her mouth. The small pale yellow grapes native to these regions 
produced a notably inferior vintage. We shall have no trade in wine. Besides, the Great Masters had 
burned the best arbors along with the olive trees. 
In the afternoon a sculptor came, proposing to replace the head of the great bronze harpy in the 
Plaza of Purification with one cast in Dany’s image. She denied him with as much courtesy as she could 
muster. A pike of unprecedented size had been caught in the Skahazadhan, and the fisherman wished to 
give it to the queen. She admired the fish extravagantly, rewarded the fisherman with a purse of silver, 
and sent the pike to her kitchens. A coppersmith had fashioned her a suit of burnished rings to wear to 
war. She accepted it with fulsome thanks; it was lovely to behold, and all that burnished copper would 
flash prettily in the sun, though if actual battle threatened, she would sooner be clad in steel. Even a 
young girl who knew nothing of the ways of war knew that. 
The slippers the Butcher King had sent her had grown too uncomfortable. Dany kicked them off 
and sat with one foot tucked beneath her and the other swinging back and forth. It was not a very regal 
pose, but she was tired of being regal. The crown had given her a headache, and her buttocks had gone 
to sleep. “Ser Barristan,” she called, “I know what quality a king needs most.” 
“Courage, Your Grace?” 
“Cheeks like iron,” she teased. “All I do is sit.” 
“Your Grace takes too much on herself. You should allow your councillors to shoulder more of 
your burdens.” 
“I have too many councillors and too few cushions.” Dany turned to Reznak. “How many more?” 
“ Three-and-twenty, if it please Your Magnificence. With as many claims.” The seneschal 
consulted some papers. “One calf and three goats. The rest will be sheep or lambs, no doubt.” 
“ Three-and-twenty.” Dany sighed. “My dragons have developed a prodigious taste for mutton 
since we began to pay the shepherds for their kills. Have these claims been proven?” 
“Some men have brought burnt bones.” 

“Men make fires. Men cook mutton. Burnt bones prove nothing. Brown Ben says there are red 
wolves in the hills outside the city, and jack-als and wild dogs. Must we pay good silver for every lamb 
that goes astray between Yunkai and the Skahazadhan?” 
“No, Magnificence.” Reznak bowed. “Shall I send these rascals away, or will you want them 
scourged?” 
Daenerys shifted on the bench. “No man should ever fear to come to me.” Some claims were 
false, she did not doubt, but more were genuine. Her dragons had grown too large to be content with 
rats and cats and dogs. The more they eat, the larger they will grow, Ser Barristan had warned her, and 
the larger they grow, the more they’ll eat. Drogon especially ranged far afield and could easily devour a 
sheep a day. “Pay them for the value of their animals,” she told Reznak, “but henceforth claimants must 
present themselves at the Temple of the Graces and swear a holy oath before the gods of Ghis.” 
“It shall be done.” Reznak turned to the petitioners. “Her Magnificence the Queen has 
consented to compensate each of you for the animals you have lost,” he told them in the Ghiscari 
tongue. “Present yourselves to my factors on the morrow, and you shall be paid in coin or kind, as you 
prefer.” 
The pronouncement was received in sullen silence. You would think they might be happier, Dany 
thought. They have what they came for. Is there no way to please these people? 
One man lingered behind as the rest were filing out—a squat man with a windburnt face, 
shabbily dressed. His hair was a cap of coarse red-black wire cropped about his ears, and in one hand he 
held a sad cloth sack. He stood with his head down, gazing at the marble floor as if he had quite 
forgotten where he was. And what does this one want? Dany wondered. 
“All kneel for Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the 
Rhoynar and the First Men, Khaleesi of Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Shackles, and Mother of Dragons,” 
cried Missandei in her high, sweet voice. 
As Dany stood, her tokar began to slip. She caught it and tugged it back in place. “You with the 
sack,” she called, “did you wish to speak with us? You may approach.” 
When he raised his head, his eyes were red and raw as open sores. Dany glimpsed Ser Barristan 
sliding closer, a white shadow at her side. The man approached in a stumbling shuffle, one step and then 
another, clutching his sack. Is he drunk, or ill? she wondered. There was dirt beneath his cracked yellow 
fingernails. 
“What is it?” Dany asked. “Do you have some grievance to lay before us, some petition? What 
would you have of us?” 
His tongue flicked nervously over chapped, cracked lips. “I … I brought …” 
“Bones?” she said, impatiently. “Burnt bones?” 

He lifted the sack, and spilled its contents on the marble. 
Bones they were, broken bones and blackened. The longer ones had been cracked open for their 
marrow. 
“It were the black one,” the man said, in a Ghiscari growl, “the winged shadow. He come down 
from the sky and … and …” 
No. Dany shivered. No, no, oh no. 
“Are you deaf, fool?” Reznak mo Reznak demanded of the man. “Did you not hear my 
pronouncement? See my factors on the morrow, and you shall be paid for your sheep.” 
“Reznak,” Ser Barristan said quietly, “hold your tongue and open your eyes. Those are no sheep 
bones.” 
No, Dany thought, those are the bones of a child. 
JON 
The white wolf raced through a black wood, beneath a pale cliff as tall as the sky. The moon ran 
with him, slipping through a tangle of bare branches overhead, across the starry sky. 
“Snow,” the moon murmured. The wolf made no answer. Snow crunched beneath his paws. The 
wind sighed through the trees. 
Far off, he could hear his packmates calling to him, like to like. They were hunting too. A wild 
rain lashed down upon his black brother as he tore at the flesh of an enormous goat, washing the blood 
from his side where the goat’s long horn had raked him. In another place, his little sister lifted her head 
to sing to the moon, and a hundred small grey cousins broke off their hunt to sing with her. The hills 
were warmer where they were, and full of food. Many a night his sister’s pack gorged on the flesh of 
sheep and cows and horses, the prey of men, and sometimes even on the flesh of man himself. 
“Snow,” the moon called down again, cackling. The white wolf padded along the man trail 
beneath the icy cliff. The taste of blood was on his tongue, and his ears rang to the song of the hundred 
cousins. Once they had been six, five whimpering blind in the snow beside their dead mother, sucking 
cool milk from her hard dead nipples whilst he crawled off alone. Four remained … and one the white 
wolf could no longer sense. 
“Snow,” the moon insisted. 
The white wolf ran from it, racing toward the cave of night where the sun had hidden, his breath 
frosting in the air. On starless nights the great cliff was as black as stone, a darkness towering high above 

the wide world, but when the moon came out it shimmered pale and icy as a frozen stream. The wolf’s 
pelt was thick and shaggy, but when the wind blew along the ice no fur could keep the chill out. On the 
other side the wind was colder still, the wolf sensed. That was where his brother was, the grey brother 
who smelled of summer. 
“Snow.” An icicle tumbled from a branch. The white wolf turned and bared his teeth. “Snow!” 
His fur rose bristling, as the woods dissolved around him. “Snow, snow, snow!” He heard the beat of 
wings. Through the gloom a raven flew. 
It landed on Jon Snow’s chest with a thump and a scrabbling of claws. “SNOW!” it screamed into 
his face. 
“I hear you.” The room was dim, his pallet hard. Grey light leaked through the shutters, 
promising another bleak cold day. “Is this how you woke Mormont? Get your feathers out of my face.” 
Jon wriggled an arm out from under his blankets to shoo the raven off. It was a big bird, old and bold 
and scruffy, utterly without fear. “Snow,” it cried, flapping to his bedpost. “Snow, snow.” Jon filled his 
fist with a pillow and let fly, but the bird took to the air. The pillow struck the wall and burst, scattering 
stuffing everywhere just as Dolorous Edd Tollett poked his head through the door. “Beg pardon,” he 
said, ignoring the flurry of feathers, “shall I fetch m’lord some breakfast?” 
“Corn,” cried the raven. “Corn, corn.” 
“Roast raven,” Jon suggested. “And half a pint of ale.” Having a steward fetch and serve for him 
still felt strange; not long ago, it would have been him fetching breakfast for Lord Commander 
Mormont. 
“Three corns and one roast raven,” said Dolorous Edd. “Very good, m’lord, only Hobb’s made 
boiled eggs, black sausage, and apples stewed with prunes. The apples stewed with prunes are 
excellent, except for the prunes. I won’t eat prunes myself. Well, there was one time when Hobb 
chopped them up with chestnuts and carrots and hid them in a hen. Never trust a cook, my lord. They’ll 
prune you when you least expect it.” 
“Later.” Breakfast could wait; Stannis could not. “Any trouble from the stockades last night?” 
“Not since you put guards on the guards, m’lord.” 
“Good.” A thousand wildlings had been penned up beyond the Wall, the captives Stannis 
Baratheon had taken when his knights had smashed Mance Rayder’s patchwork host. Many of the 
prisoners were women, and some of the guards had been sneaking them out to warm their beds. King’s 
men, queen’s men, it did not seem to matter; a few black brothers had tried the same thing. Men were 
men, and these were the only women for a thousand leagues. 
“Two more wildlings turned up to surrender,” Edd went on. “A mother with a girl clinging to her 
skirts. She had a boy babe too, all swaddled up in fur, but he was dead.” 

“Dead,” said the raven. It was one of the bird’s favorite words. “Dead, dead, dead.” 
They had free folk drifting in most every night, starved half-frozen creatures who had run from 
the battle beneath the Wall only to crawl back when they realized there was no safe place to run to. 
“Was the mother questioned?” Jon asked. Stannis Baratheon had smashed Mance Rayder’s host and 
made the King-Beyond-the-Wall his captive … but the wildlings were still out there, the Weeper and 
Tormund Giantsbane and thousands more. 
“Aye, m’lord,” said Edd, “but all she knows is that she ran off during the battle and hid in the 
woods after. We filled her full of porridge, sent her to the pens, and burned the babe.” 
Burning dead children had ceased to trouble Jon Snow; live ones were another matter. Two 
kings to wake the dragon. The father first and then the son, so both die kings. The words had been 
murmured by one of the queen’s men as Maester Aemon had cleaned his wounds. Jon had tried to 
dismiss them as his fever talking. Aemon had demurred. “There is power in a king’s blood,” the old 
maester had warned, “and better men than Stannis have done worse things than this.” The king can be 
harsh and unforgiving, aye, but a babe still on the breast? Only a monster would give a living child to the 
flames. 
Jon pissed in darkness, filling his chamber pot as the Old Bear’s raven muttered complaints. The 
wolf dreams had been growing stronger, and he found himself remembering them even when awake. 
Ghost knows that Grey Wind is dead. Robb had died at the Twins, betrayed by men he’d believed his 
friends, and his wolf had perished with him. Bran and Rickon had been murdered too, beheaded at the 
behest of Theon Greyjoy, who had once been their lord father’s ward … but if dreams did not lie, their 
direwolves had escaped. At Queenscrown, one had come out of the darkness to save Jon’s life. Summer, 
it had to be. His fur was grey, and Shaggydog is black. He wondered if some part of his dead brothers 
lived on inside their wolves. 
He filled his basin from the flagon of water beside his bed, washed his face and hands, donned a 
clean set of black woolens, laced up a black leather jerkin, and pulled on a pair of well-worn boots. 
Mormont’s raven watched with shrewd black eyes, then fluttered to the window. “Do you take me for 
your thrall?” When Jon folded back the window with its thick diamond-shaped panes of yellow glass, the 
chill of the morning hit him in the face. He took a breath to clear away the cobwebs of the night as the 
raven flapped away. That bird is too clever by half. It had been the Old Bear’s companion for long years, 
but that had not stopped it from eating Mormont’s face once he died. 
Outside his bedchamber a flight of steps descended to a larger room furnished with a scarred 
pinewood table and a dozen oak-and-leather chairs. With Stannis in the King’s Tower and the Lord 
Commander’s Tower burned to a shell, Jon had established himself in Donal Noye’s modest rooms 
behind the armory. In time, no doubt, he would need larger quarters, but for the moment these would 
serve whilst he accustomed himself to command. 
The grant that the king had presented him for signature was on the table beneath a silver 
drinking cup that had once been Donal Noye’s. The one-armed smith had left few personal effects: the 

cup, six pennies and a copper star, a niello brooch with a broken clasp, a musty brocade doublet that 
bore the stag of Storm’s End. His treasures were his tools, and the swords and knives he made. His life 
was at the forge. Jon moved the cup aside and read the parchment once again. If I put my seal to this, I 
will forever be remembered as the lord commander who gave away the Wall, he thought, but if I should 
refuse … 
Stannis Baratheon was proving to be a prickly guest, and a restless one. He had ridden down the 
kingsroad almost as far as Queenscrown, prowled through the empty hovels of Mole’s Town, inspected 
the ruined forts at Queensgate and Oakenshield. Each night he walked atop the Wall with Lady 
Melisandre, and during the days he visited the stockades, picking captives out for the red woman to 
question. He does not like to be balked. This would not be a pleasant morning, Jon feared. 
From the armory came a clatter of shields and swords, as the latest lot of boys and raw recruits 
armed themselves. He could hear the voice of Iron Emmett telling them to be quick about it. Cotter Pyke 
had not been pleased to lose him, but the young ranger had a gift for training men. He loves to fight, and 
he’ll teach his boys to love it too. Or so he hoped. 
Jon’s cloak hung on a peg by the door, his sword belt on another. He donned them both and 
made his way to the armory. The rug where Ghost slept was empty, he saw. Two guardsmen stood 
inside the doors, clad in black cloaks and iron halfhelms, spears in their hands. “Will m’lord be wanting a 
tail?” asked Garse. 
“I think I can find the King’s Tower by myself.” Jon hated having guards trailing after him 
everywhere he went. It made him feel like a mother duck leading a procession of ducklings. 
Iron Emmett’s lads were well at it in the yard, blunted swords slamming into shields and ringing 
against one another. Jon stopped to watch a moment as Horse pressed Hop-Robin back toward the well. 
Horse had the makings of a good fighter, he decided. He was strong and getting stronger, and his 
instincts were sound. Hop-Robin was another tale. His clubfoot was bad enough, but he was afraid of 
getting hit as well. Perhaps we can make a steward of him. The fight ended abruptly, with Hop-Robin on 
the ground. 
“Well fought,” Jon said to Horse, “but you drop your shield too low when pressing an attack. You 
will want to correct that, or it is like to get you killed.” 
“Yes, m’lord. I’ll keep it higher next time.” Horse pulled Hop-Robin to his feet, and the smaller 
boy made a clumsy bow. 
A few of Stannis’s knights were sparring on the far side of the yard. King’s men in one corner and 
queen’s men in another, Jon did not fail to note, but only a few. It’s too cold for most of them. As he 
strode past them, a booming voice called after him. “BOY! YOU THERE! BOY!” 
Boy was not the worst of the things that Jon Snow had been called since being chosen lord 
commander. He ignored it. 

“Snow,” the voice insisted, “Lord Commander.” 
This time he stopped. “Ser?” 
The knight overtopped him by six inches. “A man who bears Valyrian steel should use it for more 
than scratching his arse.” 
Jon had seen this one about the castle—a knight of great renown, to hear him tell it. During the 
battle beneath the Wall, Ser Godry Farring had slain a fleeing giant, pounding after him on horseback 
and driving a lance through his back, then dismounting to hack off the creature’s pitiful small head. The 
queen’s men had taken to calling him Godry the Giantslayer. 
Jon remembered Ygritte, crying. I am the last of the giants. “I use Longclaw when I must, ser.” 
“How well, though?” Ser Godry drew his own blade. “Show us. I promise not to hurt you, lad.” 
How kind of you. “Some other time, ser. I fear that I have other duties just now.” 
“You fear. I see that.” Ser Godry grinned at his friends. “He fears,” he repeated, for the slow 
ones. 
“You will excuse me.” Jon showed them his back. 
Castle Black seemed a bleak and forlorn place in the pale dawn light. My command, Jon Snow 
reflected ruefully, as much a ruin as it is a strong-hold. The Lord Commander’s Tower was a shell, the 
Common Hall a pile of blackened timbers, and Hardin’s Tower looked as if the next gust of wind would 
knock it over … though it had looked that way for years. Behind them rose the Wall: immense, 
forbidding, frigid, acrawl with builders pushing up a new switchback stair to join the remnants of the old. 
They worked from dawn to dusk. Without the stair, there was no way to reach the top of the Wall save 
by winch. That would not serve if the wildlings should attack again. 
Above the King’s Tower the great golden battle standard of House Baratheon cracked like a whip 
from the roof where Jon Snow had prowled with bow in hand not long ago, slaying Thenns and free folk 
beside Satin and Deaf Dick Follard. Two queen’s men stood shivering on the steps, their hands tucked up 
into their armpits and their spears leaning against the door. “Those cloth gloves will never serve,” Jon 
told them. “See Bowen Marsh on the morrow, and he’ll give you each a pair of leather gloves lined with 
fur.” 
“We will, m’lord, and thank you,” said the older guard. 
“That’s if our bloody hands aren’t froze off,” the younger added, his breath a pale mist. “I used 
to think that it got cold up in the Dornish Marches. What did I know?” 
Nothing, thought Jon Snow, the same as me. 
Halfway up the winding steps, he came upon Samwell Tarly, headed down. “Are you coming 
from the king?” Jon asked him. 

“Maester Aemon sent me with a letter.” 
“I see.” Some lords trusted their maesters to read their letters and convey the contents, but 
Stannis insisted on breaking the seals himself. “How did Stannis take it?” 
“Not happily, by his face.” Sam dropped his voice to a whisper. “I am not supposed to speak of 
it.” 
“Then don’t.” Jon wondered which of his father’s bannermen had refused King Stannis homage 
this time. He was quick enough to spread the word when Karhold declared for him. “How are you and 
your longbow getting on?” 
“I found a good book about archery.” Sam frowned. “Doing it is harder than reading about it, 
though. I get blisters.” 
“Keep at it. We may need your bow on the Wall if the Others turn up some dark night.” 
“Oh, I hope not.” 
More guards stood outside the king’s solar. “No arms are allowed in His Grace’s presence, my 
lord,” their serjeant said. “I’ll need that sword. Your knives as well.” It would do no good to protest, Jon 
knew. He handed them his weaponry. 
Within the solar the air was warm. Lady Melisandre was seated near the fire, her ruby 
glimmering against the pale skin of her throat. Ygritte had been kissed by fire; the red priestess was fire, 
and her hair was blood and flame. Stannis stood behind the rough-hewn table where the Old Bear had 
once been wont to sit and take his meals. Covering the table was a large map of the north, painted on a 
ragged piece of hide. A tallow candle weighed down one end of it, a steel gauntlet the other. 
The king wore lambswool breeches and a quilted doublet, yet somehow he looked as stiff and 
uncomfortable as if he had been clad in plate and mail. His skin was pale leather, his beard cropped so 
short that it might have been painted on. A fringe about his temples was all that remained of his black 
hair. In his hand was a parchment with a broken seal of dark green wax. 
Jon took a knee. The king frowned at him, and rattled the parchment angrily. “Rise. Tell me, who 
is Lyanna Mormont?” 
“One of Lady Maege’s daughters, Sire. The youngest. She was named for my lord father’s sister.” 
“To curry your lord father’s favor, I don’t doubt. I know how that game is played. How old is this 
wretched girl child?” 
Jon had to think a moment. “Ten. Or near enough to make no matter. Might I know how she has 
offended Your Grace?” 
Stannis read from the letter. “Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name 
is STARK. A girl of ten, you say, and she presumes to scold her lawful king.” His close-cropped beard lay 

like a shadow over his hollow cheeks. “See that you keep these tidings to yourself, Lord Snow. Karhold is 
with me, that is all the men need know. I will not have your brothers trading tales of how this child spat 
on me.” 
“As you command, Sire.” Maege Mormont had ridden south with Robb, Jon knew. Her eldest 
daughter had joined the Young Wolf’s host as well. Even if both of them had died, however, Lady Maege 
had other daughters, some with children of their own. Had they gone with Robb as well? Surely Lady 
Maege would have left at least one of the older girls behind as castellan. He did not understand why 
Lyanna should be writing Stannis, and could not help but wonder if the girl’s answer might have been 
different if the letter had been sealed with a direwolf instead of a crowned stag, and signed by Jon Stark, 
Lord of Winterfell. It is too late for such misgivings. You made your choice. 
“Two score ravens were sent out,” the king complained, “yet we get no response but silence and 
defiance. Homage is the duty every leal subject owes his king. Yet your father’s bannermen all turn their 
back on me, save the Karstarks. Is Arnolf Karstark the only man of honor in the north?” 
Arnolf Karstark was the late Lord Rickard’s uncle. He had been made the castellan of Karhold 
when his nephew and his sons went south with Robb, and he had been the first to respond to King 
Stannis’s call for homage, with a raven declaring his allegiance. The Karstarks have no other choice, Jon 
might have said. Rickard Karstark had betrayed the direwolf and spilled the blood of lions. The stag was 
Karhold’s only hope. “In times as confused as these, even men of honor must wonder where their duty 
lies. Your Grace is not the only king in the realm demanding homage.” 
Lady Melisandre stirred. “Tell me, Lord Snow … where were these other kings when the wild 
people stormed your Wall?” 
“A thousand leagues away and deaf to our need,” Jon replied. “I have not forgotten that, my 
lady. Nor will I. But my father’s bannermen have wives and children to protect, and smallfolk who will 
die should they choose wrongly. His Grace asks much of them. Give them time, and you will have your 
answers.” 
“Answers such as this?” Stannis crushed Lyanna’s letter in his fist. 
“Even in the north men fear the wroth of Tywin Lannister. Boltons make bad enemies as well. It 
is not happenstance that put a flayed man on their banners. They north rode with Robb, bled with him, 
died for him. They have supped on grief and death, and now you come to offer them another serving. 
Do you blame them if they hang back? Forgive me, Your Grace, but some will look at you and see only 
another doomed pretender.” 
“If His Grace is doomed, your realm is doomed as well,” said Lady Melisandre. “Remember that, 
Lord Snow. It is the one true king of Westeros who stands before you.” 
Jon kept his face a mask. “As you say, my lady.” 

Stannis snorted. “You spend your words as if every one were a golden dragon. I wonder, how 
much gold do you have laid by?” 
“Gold?” Are those the dragons the red woman means to wake? Dragons made of gold? “Such 
taxes as we collect are paid in kind, Your Grace. The Watch is rich in turnips but poor in coin.” 
“Turnips are not like to appease Salladhor Saan. I require gold or silver.” 
“For that, you need White Harbor. The city cannot compare to Old-town or King’s Landing, but it 
is still a thriving port. Lord Manderly is the richest of my lord father’s bannermen.” 
“Lord Too-Fat-to-Sit-a-Horse.” The letter that Lord Wyman Manderly had sent back from White 
Harbor had spoken of his age and infirmity, and little more. Stannis had commanded Jon not to speak of 
that one either. 
“Perhaps his lordship would fancy a wildling wife,” said Lady Melisandre. “Is this fat man 
married, Lord Snow?” 
“His lady wife is long dead. Lord Wyman has two grown sons, and grandchildren by the elder. 
And he is too fat to sit a horse, thirty stone at least. Val would never have him.” 
“Just once you might try to give me an answer that would please me, Lord Snow,” the king 
grumbled. 
“I would hope the truth would please you, Sire. Your men call Val a princess, but to the free folk 
she is only the sister of their king’s dead wife. If you force her to marry a man she does not want, she is 
like to slit his throat on their wedding night. Even if she accepts her husband, that does not mean the 
wildlings will follow him, or you. The only man who can bind them to your cause is Mance Rayder.” 
“I know that,” Stannis said, unhappily. “I have spent hours speaking with the man. He knows 
much and more of our true enemy, and there is cunning in him, I’ll grant you. Even if he were to 
renounce his kingship, though, the man remains an oathbreaker. Suffer one deserter to live, and you 
encourage others to desert. No. Laws should be made of iron, not of pudding. Mance Rayder’s life is 
forfeit by every law of the Seven Kingdoms.” 
“The law ends at the Wall, Your Grace. You could make good use of Mance.” 
“I mean to. I’ll burn him, and the north will see how I deal with turncloaks and traitors. I have 
other men to lead the wildlings. And I have Rayder’s son, do not forget. Once the father dies, his whelp 
will be the King-Beyond-the-Wall.” 
“Your Grace is mistaken.” You know nothing, Jon Snow, Ygritte used to say, but he had learned. 
“The babe is no more a prince than Val is a princess. You do not become King-Beyond-the-Wall because 
your father was.” 
“Good,” said Stannis, “for I will suffer no other kings in Westeros. Have you signed the grant?” 

“No, Your Grace.” And now it comes. Jon closed his burned fingers and opened them again. “You 
ask too much.” 
“Ask? I asked you to be Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. I require these castles.” 
“We have ceded you the Nightfort.” 
“Rats and ruins. It is a niggard’s gift that costs the giver nothing. Your own man Yarwyck says it 
will be half a year before the castle can be made fit for habitation.” 
“The other forts are no better.” 
“I know that. It makes no matter. They are all we have. There are nineteen forts along the Wall, 
and you have men in only three of them. I mean to have every one of them garrisoned again before the 
year is out.” 
“I have no quarrel with that, Sire, but it is being said that you also mean to grant these castles to 
your knights and lords, to hold as their own seats as vassals to Your Grace.” 
“Kings are expected to be open-handed to their followers. Did Lord Eddard teach his bastard 
nothing? Many of my knights and lords abandoned rich lands and stout castles in the south. Should their 
loyalty go unrewarded?” 
“If Your Grace wishes to lose all of my lord father’s bannermen, there is no more certain way 
than by giving northern halls to southron lords.” 
“How can I lose men I do not have? I had hoped to bestow Winterfell on a northman, you may 
recall. A son of Eddard Stark. He threw my offer in my face.” Stannis Baratheon with a grievance was like 
a mastiff with a bone; he gnawed it down to splinters. 
“By right Winterfell should go to my sister Sansa.” 
“Lady Lannister, you mean? Are you so eager to see the Imp perched on your father’s seat? I 
promise you, that will not happen whilst I live, Lord Snow.” 
Jon knew better than to press the point. “Sire, some claim that you mean to grant lands and 
castles to Rattleshirt and the Magnar of Thenn.” 
“Who told you that?” 
The talk was all over Castle Black. “If you must know, I had the tale from Gilly.” 
“Who is Gilly?” 
“The wet nurse,” said Lady Melisandre. “Your Grace gave her freedom of the castle.” 
“Not for running tales. She’s wanted for her teats, not for her tongue. I’ll have more milk from 
her, and fewer messages.” 

“Castle Black needs no useless mouths,” Jon agreed. “I am sending Gilly south on the next ship 
out of Eastwatch.” 
Melisandre touched the ruby at her neck. “Gilly is giving suck to Dalla’s son as well as her own. It 
seems cruel of you to part our little prince from his milk brother, my lord.” 
Careful now, careful. “Mother’s milk is all they share. Gilly’s son is larger and more robust. He 
kicks the prince and pinches him, and shoves him from the breast. Craster was his father, a cruel man 
and greedy, and blood tells.” 
The king was confused. “I thought the wet nurse was this man Craster’s daughter?” 
“Wife and daughter both, Your Grace. Craster married all his daughters. Gilly’s boy was the fruit 
of their union.” 
“Her own father got this child on her?” Stannis sounded shocked. “We are well rid of her, then. I 
will not suffer such abominations here. This is not King’s Landing.” 
“I can find another wet nurse. If there’s none amongst the wildlings, I will send to the mountain 
clans. Until such time, goat’s milk should suffice for the boy, if it please Your Grace.” 
“Poor fare for a prince … but better than whore’s milk, aye.” Stannis drummed his fingers on the 
map. “If we may return to the matter of these forts …” 
“Your Grace,” said Jon, with chilly courtesy, “I have housed your men and fed them, at dire cost 
to our winter stores. I have clothed them so they would not freeze.” 
Stannis was not appeased. “Aye, you’ve shared your salt pork and porridge, and you’ve thrown 
us some black rags to keep us warm. Rags the wildlings would have taken off your corpses if I had not 
come north.” 
Jon ignored that. “I have given you fodder for your horses, and once the stair is done I will lend 
you builders to restore the Nightfort. I have even agreed to allow you to settle wildlings on the Gift, 
which was given to the Night’s Watch in perpetuity.” 
“You offer me empty lands and desolations, yet deny me the castles I require to reward my lords 
and bannermen.” 
“The Night’s Watch built those castles …” 
“And the Night’s Watch abandoned them.” 
“… to defend the Wall,” Jon finished stubbornly, “not as seats for southron lords. The stones of 
those forts are mortared with the blood and bones of my brothers, long dead. I cannot give them to 
you.” 

“Cannot or will not?” The cords in the king’s neck stood out sharp as swords. “I offered you a 
name.” 
“I have a name, Your Grace.” 
“Snow. Was ever a name more ill-omened?” Stannis touched his sword hilt. “Just who do you 
imagine that you are?” 
“The watcher on the walls. The sword in the darkness.” 
“Don’t prate your words at me.” Stannis drew the blade he called Lightbringer. “Here is your 
sword in the darkness.” Light rippled up and down the blade, now red, now yellow, now orange, 
painting the king’s face in harsh, bright hues. “Even a green boy should be able to see that. Are you 
blind?” 
“No, Sire. I agree these castles must be garrisoned—” 
“The boy commander agrees. How fortunate.” 
“—by the Night’s Watch.” 
“You do not have the men.” 
“Then give me men, Sire. I will provide officers for each of the abandoned forts, seasoned 
commanders who know the Wall and the lands beyond, and how best to survive the coming winter. In 
return for all we’ve given you, grant me the men to fill out the garrisons. Men-at-arms, cross-bowmen, 
raw boys. I will even take your wounded and infirm.” 
Stannis stared at him incredulously, then gave a bark of laughter. “You are bold enough, Snow, I 
grant you that, but you’re mad if you think my men will take the black.” 
“They can wear any color cloak they choose, so long as they obey my officers as they would your 
own.” 
The king was unmoved. “I have knights and lords in my service, scions of noble Houses old in 
honor. They cannot be expected to serve under poachers, peasants, and murderers.” 
Or bastards, Sire? “Your own Hand is a smuggler.” 
“Was a smuggler. I shortened his fingers for that. They tell me that you are the 
nine-hundred-ninety-eighth man to command the Night’s Watch, Lord Snow. What do you think the 
nine-hundred-ninety-ninth might say about these castles? The sight of your head on a spike might 
inspire him to be more helpful.” The king laid his bright blade down on the map, along the Wall, its steel 
shimmering like sunlight on water. “You are only lord commander by my sufferance. You would do well 
to remember that.” 

“I am lord commander because my brothers chose me.” There were mornings when Jon Snow 
did not quite believe it himself, when he woke up thinking surely this was some mad dream. It’s like 
putting on new clothes, Sam had told him. The fit feels strange at first, but once you’ve worn them for a 
while you get to feeling comfortable. 
“Alliser Thorne complains about the manner of your choosing, and I cannot say he does not 
have a grievance.” The map lay between them like a battleground, drenched by the colors of the 
glowing sword. “The count was done by a blind man with your fat friend by his elbow. And Slynt names 
you a turncloak.” 
And who would know one better than Slynt? “A turncloak would tell you what you wished to 
hear and betray you later. Your Grace knows that I was fairly chosen. My father always said you were a 
just man.” Just but harsh had been Lord Eddard’s exact words, but Jon did not think it would be wise to 
share that. 
“Lord Eddard was no friend to me, but he was not without some sense. He would have given me 
these castles.” 
Never. “I cannot speak to what my father might have done. I took an oath, Your Grace. The Wall 
is mine.” 
“For now. We will see how well you hold it.” Stannis pointed at him. “Keep your ruins, as they 
mean so much to you. I promise you, though, if any remain empty when the year is out, I will take them 
with your leave or without it. And if even one should fall to the foe, your head will soon follow. Now get 
out.” 
Lady Melisandre rose from her place near the hearth. “With your leave, Sire, I will show Lord 
Snow back to his chambers.” 
“Why? He knows the way.” Stannis waved them both away. “Do what you will. Devan, food. 
Boiled eggs and lemon water.” 
After the warmth of the king’s solar, the turnpike stair felt bone-chillingly cold. “Wind’s rising, 
m’lady,” the serjeant warned Melisandre as he handed Jon back his weapons. “You might want a 
warmer cloak.” 
“I have my faith to warm me.” The red woman walked beside Jon down the steps. “His Grace is 
growing fond of you.” 
“I can tell. He only threatened to behead me twice.” 
Melisandre laughed. “It is his silences you should fear, not his words.” As they stepped out into 
the yard, the wind filled Jon’s cloak and sent it flapping against her. The red priestess brushed the black 
wool aside and slipped her arm through his. “It may be that you are not wrong about the wildling king. I 
shall pray for the Lord of Light to send me guidance. When I gaze into the flames, I can see through 

stone and earth, and find the truth within men’s souls. I can speak to kings long dead and children not 
yet born, and watch the years and seasons flicker past, until the end of days.” 
“Are your fires never wrong?” 
“Never … though we priests are mortal and sometimes err, mistaking this must come for this 
may come.” 
Jon could feel her heat, even through his wool and boiled leather. The sight of them arm in arm 
was drawing curious looks. They will be whispering in the barracks tonight. “If you can truly see the 
morrow in your flames, tell me when and where the next wildling attack will come.” He slipped his arm 
free. 
“R’hllor sends us what visions he will, but I shall seek for this man Tormund in the flames.” 
Melisandre’s red lips curled into a smile. “I have seen you in my fires, Jon Snow.” 
“Is that a threat, my lady? Do you mean to burn me too?” 
“You mistake my meaning.” She gave him a searching look. “I fear that I make you uneasy, Lord 
Snow.” 
Jon did not deny it. “The Wall is no place for a woman.” 
“You are wrong. I have dreamed of your Wall, Jon Snow. Great was the lore that raised it, and 
great the spells locked beneath its ice. We walk beneath one of the hinges of the world.” Melisandre 
gazed up at it, her breath a warm moist cloud in the air. “This is my place as it is yours, and soon enough 
you may have grave need of me. Do not refuse my friendship, Jon. I have seen you in the storm, 
hard-pressed, with enemies on every side. You have so many enemies. Shall I tell you their names?” 
“I know their names.” 
“Do not be so certain.” The ruby at Melisandre’s throat gleamed red. “It is not the foes who 
curse you to your face that you must fear, but those who smile when you are looking and sharpen their 
knives when you turn your back. You would do well to keep your wolf close beside you. Ice, I see, and 
daggers in the dark. Blood frozen red and hard, and naked steel. It was very cold.” 
“It is always cold on the Wall.” 
“You think so?” 
“I know so, my lady.” 
“Then you know nothing, Jon Snow,” she whispered. 

BRAN 
Are we there yet? 
Bran never said the words aloud, but they were often on his lips as their ragged company 
trudged through groves of ancient oaks and towering grey-green sentinels, past gloomy soldier pines 
and bare brown chestnut trees. Are we near? the boy would wonder, as Hodor clambered up a stony 
slope, or descended into some dark crevice where drifts of dirty snow cracked beneath his feet. How 
much farther? he would think, as the great elk splashed across a half-frozen stream. How much longer? 
It’s so cold. Where is the three-eyed crow? 
Swaying in his wicker basket on Hodor’s back, the boy hunched down, ducking his head as the 
big stableboy passed beneath the limb of an oak. The snow was falling again, wet and heavy. Hodor 
walked with one eye frozen shut, his thick brown beard a tangle of hoarfrost, icicles drooping from the 
ends of his bushy mustache. One gloved hand still clutched the rusty iron longsword he had taken from 
the crypts below Winterfell, and from time to time he would lash out at a branch, knocking loose a spray 
of snow. “Hod-d-d-dor,” he would mutter, his teeth chattering. 
The sound was strangely reassuring. On their journey from Winterfell to the Wall, Bran and his 
companions had made the miles shorter by talking and telling tales, but it was different here. Even 
Hodor felt it. His hodors came less often than they had south of the Wall. There was a stillness to this 
wood like nothing Bran had ever known before. Before the snows began, the north wind would swirl 
around them and clouds of dead brown leaves would kick up from the ground with a faint small rustling 
sound that reminded him of roaches scurrying in a cupboard, but now all the leaves were buried under a 
blanket of white. From time to time a raven would fly overhead, big black wings slapping against the 
cold air. Elsewise the world was silent. 
Just ahead, the elk wove between the snowdrifts with his head down, his huge rack of antlers 
crusted with ice. The ranger sat astride his broad back, grim and silent. Coldhands was the name that the 
fat boy Sam had given him, for though the ranger’s face was pale, his hands were black and hard as iron, 
and cold as iron too. The rest of him was wrapped in layers of wool and boiled leather and ringmail, his 
features shadowed by his hooded cloak and a black woolen scarf about the lower half of his face. 
Behind the ranger, Meera Reed wrapped her arms around her brother, to shelter him from the 
wind and cold with the warmth of her own body. A crust of frozen snot had formed below Jojen’s nose, 
and from time to time he shivered violently. He looks so small, Bran thought, as he watched him sway. 
He looks smaller than me now, and weaker too, and I’m the cripple. 
Summer brought up the rear of their little band. The direwolf’s breath frosted the forest air as 
he padded after them, still limping on the hind leg that had taken the arrow back at Queenscrown. Bran 
felt the pain of the old wound whenever he slipped inside the big wolf’s skin. Of late Bran wore 
Summer’s body more often than his own; the wolf felt the bite of the cold, despite the thickness of his 

fur, but he could see farther and hear better and smell more than the boy in the basket, bundled up like 
a babe in swaddling clothes. 
Other times, when he was tired of being a wolf, Bran slipped into Hodor’s skin instead. The 
gentle giant would whimper when he felt him, and thrash his shaggy head from side to side, but not as 
violently as he had the first time, back at Queenscrown. He knows it’s me, the boy liked to tell himself. 
He’s used to me by now. Even so, he never felt comfortable inside Hodor’s skin. The big stableboy never 
understood what was happening, and Bran could taste the fear at the back of his mouth. It was better 
inside Summer. I am him, and he is me. He feels what I feel. 
Sometimes Bran could sense the direwolf sniffing after the elk, wondering if he could bring the 
great beast down. Summer had grown accustomed to horses at Winterfell, but this was an elk and elk 
were prey. The direwolf could sense the warm blood coursing beneath the elk’s shaggy hide. Just the 
smell was enough to make the slaver run from between his jaws, and when it did Bran’s mouth would 
water at the thought of rich, dark meat. 
From a nearby oak a raven quorked, and Bran heard the sound of wings as another of the big 
black birds flapped down to land beside it. By day only half a dozen ravens stayed with them, flitting 
from tree to tree or riding on the antlers of the elk. The rest of the murder flew ahead or lingered 
behind. But when the sun sank low they would return, descending from the sky on night-black wings 
until every branch of every tree was thick with them for yards around. Some would fly to the ranger and 
mutter at him, and it seemed to Bran that he understood their quorks and squawks. They are his eyes 
and ears. They scout for him, and whisper to him of dangers ahead and behind. 
As now. The elk stopped suddenly, and the ranger vaulted lightly from his back to land in 
knee-deep snow. Summer growled at him, his fur bristling. The direwolf did not like the way that 
Coldhands smelled. Dead meat, dry blood, a faint whiff of rot. And cold. Cold over all. 
“What is it?” Meera wanted to know. 
“Behind us,” Coldhands announced, his voice muffled by the black wool scarf across his nose 
and mouth. 
“Wolves?” Bran asked. They had known for days that they were being followed. Every night they 
heard the mournful howling of the pack, and every night the wolves seemed a little closer. Hunters, and 
hungry. They can smell how weak we are. Often Bran woke shivering hours before the dawn, listening to 
the sound of them calling to one another in the distance as he waited for the sun to rise. If there are 
wolves, there must be prey, he used to think, until it came to him that they were the prey. 
The ranger shook his head. “Men. The wolves still keep their distance. These men are not so 
shy.” 
Meera Reed pushed back her hood. The wet snow that had covered it tumbled to the ground 
with a soft thump. “How many men? Who are they?” 

“Foes. I’ll deal with them.” 
“I’ll come with you.” 
“You’ll stay. The boy must be protected. There is a lake ahead, hard frozen. When you come on 
it, turn north and follow the shoreline. You’ll come to a fishing village. Take refuge there until I can catch 
up with you.” 
Bran thought that Meera meant to argue until her brother said, “Do as he says. He knows this 
land.” Jojen’s eyes were a dark green, the color of moss, but heavy with a weariness that Bran had never 
seen in them before. The little grandfather. South of the Wall, the boy from the crannogs had seemed to 
be wise beyond his years, but up here he was as lost and frightened as the rest of them. Even so, Meera 
always listened to him. 
That was still true. Coldhands slipped between the trees, back the way they’d come, with four 
ravens flapping after him. Meera watched him go, her cheeks red with cold, breath puffing from her 
nostrils. She pulled her hood back up and gave the elk a nudge, and their trek resumed. Before they had 
gone twenty yards, though, she turned to glance behind them and said, “Men, he says. What men? Does 
he mean wildlings? Why won’t he say?” 
“He said he’d go and deal with them,” said Bran. 
“He said, aye. He said he would take us to this three-eyed crow too. That river we crossed this 
morning is the same one we crossed four days ago, I swear. We’re going in circles.” 
“Rivers turn and twist,” Bran said uncertainly, “and where there’s lakes and hills, you need to go 
around.” 
“There’s been too much going around,” Meera insisted, “and too many secrets. I don’t like it. I 
don’t like him. And I don’t trust him. Those hands of his are bad enough. He hides his face, and will not 
speak a name. Who is he? What is he? Anyone can put on a black cloak. Anyone, or any thing. He does 
not eat, he never drinks, he does not seem to feel the cold.” 
It’s true. Bran had been afraid to speak of it, but he had noticed. Whenever they took shelter for 
the night, while he and Hodor and the Reeds huddled together for warmth, the ranger kept apart. 
Sometimes Cold-hands closed his eyes, but Bran did not think he slept. And there was something else … 
“The scarf.” Bran glanced about uneasily, but there was not a raven to be seen. All the big black 
birds had left them when the ranger did. No one was listening. Even so, he kept his voice low. “The scarf 
over his mouth, it never gets all hard with ice, like Hodor’s beard. Not even when he talks.” 
Meera gave him a sharp look. “You’re right. We’ve never seen his breath, have we?” 
“No.” A puff of white heralded each of Hodor’s hodors. When Jojen or his sister spoke, their 
words could be seen too. Even the elk left a warm fog upon the air when he exhaled. 

“If he does not breathe …” 
Bran found himself remembering the tales Old Nan had told him when he was a babe. Beyond 
the Wall the monsters live, the giants and the ghouls, the stalking shadows and the dead that walk, she 
would say, tucking him in beneath his scratchy woolen blanket, but they cannot pass so long as the Wall 
stands strong and the men of the Night’s Watch are true. So go to sleep, my little Brandon, my baby boy, 
and dream sweet dreams. There are no monsters here. The ranger wore the black of the Night’s Watch, 
but what if he was not a man at all? What if he was some monster, taking them to the other monsters to 
be devoured? 
“The ranger saved Sam and the girl from the wights,” Bran said, hesitantly, “and he’s taking me 
to the three-eyed crow.” 
“Why won’t this three-eyed crow come to us? Why couldn’t he meet us at the Wall? Crows have 
wings. My brother grows weaker every day. How long can we go on?” 
Jojen coughed. “Until we get there.” 
They came upon the promised lake not long after, and turned north as the ranger had bid them. 
That was the easy part. 
The water was frozen, and the snow had been falling for so long that Bran had lost count of the 
days, turning the lake into a vast white wilderness. Where the ice was flat and the ground was bumpy, 
the going was easy, but where the wind had pushed the snow up into ridges, sometimes it was hard to 
tell where the lake ended and the shore began. Even the trees were not as infallible a guide as they 
might have hoped, for there were wooded islands in the lake, and wide areas ashore where no trees 
grew. 
The elk went where he would, regardless of the wishes of Meera and Jojen on his back. Mostly 
he stayed beneath the trees, but where the shore curved away westward he would take the more direct 
path across the frozen lake, shouldering through snowdrifts taller than Bran as the ice crackled 
underneath his hooves. Out there the wind was stronger, a cold north wind that howled across the lake, 
knifed through their layers of wool and leather, and set them all to shivering. When it blew into their 
faces, it would drive the snow into their eyes and leave them as good as blind. 
Hours passed in silence. Ahead, shadows began to steal between the trees, the long fingers of 
the dusk. Dark came early this far north. Bran had come to dread that. Each day seemed shorter than 
the last, and where the days were cold, the nights were bitter cruel. 
Meera halted them again. “We should have come on the village by now.” Her voice sounded 
hushed and strange. 
“Could we have passed it?” Bran asked. “I hope not. We need to find shelter before nightfall.” 

She was not wrong. Jojen’s lips were blue, Meera’s cheeks dark red. Bran’s own face had gone 
numb. Hodor’s beard was solid ice. Snow caked his legs almost to the knee, and Bran had felt him 
stagger more than once. No one was as strong as Hodor, no one. If even his great strength was failing … 
“Summer can find the village,” Bran said suddenly, his words misting in the air. He did not wait 
to hear what Meera might say, but closed his eyes and let himself flow from his broken body. 
As he slipped inside Summer’s skin, the dead woods came to sudden life. Where before there 
had been silence, now he heard: wind in the trees, Hodor’s breathing, the elk pawing at the ground in 
search of fodder. Familiar scents filled his nostrils: wet leaves and dead grass, the rotted carcass of a 
squirrel decaying in the brush, the sour stink of man-sweat, the musky odor of the elk. Food. Meat. The 
elk sensed his interest. He turned his head toward the direwolf, wary, and lowered his great antlers. 
He is not prey, the boy whispered to the beast who shared his skin. Leave him. Run. 
Summer ran. Across the lake he raced, his paws kicking up sprays of snow behind him. The trees 
stood shoulder to shoulder, like men in a battle line, all cloaked in white. Over roots and rocks the 
direwolf sped, through a drift of old snow, the crust crackling beneath his weight. His paws grew wet 
and cold. The next hill was covered with pines, and the sharp scent of their needles filled the air. When 
he reached the top, he turned in a circle, sniffing at the air, then raised his head and howled. 
The smells were there. Mansmells. 
Ashes, Bran thought, old and faint, but ashes. It was the smell of burnt wood, soot, and charcoal. 
A dead fire. 
He shook the snow off his muzzle. The wind was gusting, so the smells were hard to follow. The 
wolf turned this way and that, sniffing. All around were heaps of snow and tall trees garbed in white. 
The wolf let his tongue loll out between his teeth, tasting the frigid air, his breath misting as snow-flakes 
melted on his tongue. When he trotted toward the scent, Hodor lumbered after him at once. The elk 
took longer to decide, so Bran returned reluctantly to his own body and said, “That way. Follow 
Summer. I smelled it.” 
As the first sliver of a crescent moon came peeking through the clouds, they finally stumbled 
into the village by the lake. They had almost walked straight through it. From the ice, the village looked 
no different than a dozen other spots along the lakeshore. Buried under drifts of snow, the round stone 
houses could just as easily have been boulders or hillocks or fallen logs, like the deadfall that Jojen had 
mistaken for a building the day before, until they dug down into it and found only broken branches and 
rotting logs. 
The village was empty, abandoned by the wildlings who had once lived there, like all the other 
villages they had passed. Some had been burned, as if the inhabitants had wanted to make certain they 
could not come creeping back, but this one had been spared the torch. Beneath the snow they found a 
dozen huts and a longhall, with its sod roof and thick walls of rough-hewn logs. 

“At least we will be out of the wind,” Bran said. 
“Hodor,” said Hodor. 
Meera slid down from the elk’s back. She and her brother helped lift Bran out of the wicker 
basket. “Might be the wildlings left some food behind,” she said. 
That proved a forlorn hope. Inside the longhall they found the ashes of a fire, floors of 
hard-packed dirt, a chill that went bone deep. But at least they had a roof above their heads and log 
walls to keep the wind off. A stream ran nearby, covered with a film of ice. The elk had to crack it with 
his hoof to drink. Once Bran and Jojen and Hodor were safely settled, Meera fetched back some chunks 
of broken ice for them to suck on. The melting water was so cold it made Bran shudder. 
Summer did not follow them into the longhall. Bran could feel the big wolf’s hunger, a shadow 
of his own. “Go hunt,” he told him, “but you leave the elk alone.” Part of him was wishing he could go 
hunting too. Perhaps he would, later. 
Supper was a fistful of acorns, crushed and pounded into paste, so bitter that Bran gagged as he 
tried to keep it down. Jojen Reed did not even make the attempt. Younger and frailer than his sister, he 
was growing weaker by the day. 
“Jojen, you have to eat,” Meera told him. “Later. I just want to rest.” Jojen smiled a wan smile. 
“This is not the day I die, sister. I promise you.” 
“You almost fell off the elk.” 
“Almost. I am cold and hungry, that’s all.” 
“Then eat.” 
“Crushed acorns? My belly hurts, but that will only make it worse. Leave me be, sister. I’m 
dreaming of roast chicken.” 
“Dreams will not sustain you. Not even greendreams.” 
“Dreams are what we have.” 
All we have. The last of the food that they had brought from the south was ten days gone. Since 
then hunger walked beside them day and night. Even Summer could find no game in these woods. They 
lived on crushed acorns and raw fish. The woods were full of frozen streams and cold black lakes, and 
Meera was as good a fisher with her three-pronged frog spear as most men were with hook and line. 
Some days her lips were blue with cold by the time she waded back to them with her catch wriggling on 
her tines. It had been three days since Meera caught a fish, however. Bran’s belly felt so hollow it might 
have been three years. 

After they choked down their meagre supper, Meera sat with her back against a wall, 
sharpening her dagger on a whetstone. Hodor squatted down beside the door, rocking back and forth 
on his haunches and muttering, “Hodor, hodor, hodor.” 
Bran closed his eyes. It was too cold to talk, and they dare not light a fire. Coldhands had warned 
them against that. These woods are not as empty as you think, he had said. You cannot know what the 
light might summon from the darkness. The memory made him shiver, despite the warmth of Hodor 
beside him. 
Sleep would not come, could not come. Instead there was wind, the biting cold, moonlight on 
snow, and fire. He was back inside Summer, long leagues away, and the night was rank with the smell of 
blood. The scent was strong. A kill, not far. The flesh would still be warm. Slaver ran between his teeth 
as the hunger woke inside him. Not elk. Not deer. Not this. 
The direwolf moved toward the meat, a gaunt grey shadow sliding from tree to tree, through 
pools of moonlight and over mounds of snow. The wind gusted around him, shifting. He lost the scent, 
found it, then lost it again. As he searched for it once more, a distant sound made his ears prick up. 
Wolf, he knew at once. Summer stalked toward the sound, wary now. Soon enough the scent of 
blood was back, but now there were other smells: piss and dead skins, bird shit, feathers, and wolf, wolf, 
wolf. A pack. He would need to fight for his meat. 
They smelled him too. As he moved out from amongst the darkness of the trees into the bloody 
glade, they were watching him. The female was chewing on a leather boot that still had half a leg in it, 
but she let it fall at his approach. The leader of the pack, an old male with a grizzled white muzzle and a 
blind eye, moved out to meet him, snarling, his teeth bared. Behind him, a younger male showed his 
fangs as well. 
The direwolf’s pale yellow eyes drank in the sights around them. A nest of entrails coiled 
through a bush, entangled with the branches. Steam rising from an open belly, rich with the smells of 
blood and meat. A head staring sightlessly up at a horned moon, cheeks ripped and torn down to bloody 
bone, pits for eyes, neck ending in a ragged stump. A pool of frozen blood, glistening red and black. 
Men. The stink of them filled the world. Alive, they had been as many as the fingers on a man’s 
paw, but now they were none. Dead. Done. Meat. Cloaked and hooded, once, but the wolves had torn 
their clothing into pieces in their frenzy to get at the flesh. Those who still had faces wore thick beards 
crusted with ice and frozen snot. The falling snow had begun to bury what remained of them, so pale 
against the black of ragged cloaks and breeches. Black. 
Long leagues away, the boy stirred uneasily. 
Black. Night’s Watch. They were Night’s Watch. 
The direwolf did not care. They were meat. He was hungry. 

The eyes of the three wolves glowed yellow. The direwolf swung his head from side to side, 
nostrils flaring, then bared his fangs in a snarl. The younger male backed away. The direwolf could smell 
the fear in him. Tail, he knew. But the one-eyed wolf answered with a growl and moved to block his 
advance. Head. And he does not fear me though I am twice his size. 
Their eyes met. 
Warg! 
Then the two rushed together, wolf and direwolf, and there was no more time for thought. The 
world shrank down to tooth and claw, snow flying as they rolled and spun and tore at one another, the 
other wolves snarling and snapping around them. His jaws closed on matted fur slick with hoarfrost, on 
a limb thin as a dry stick, but the one-eyed wolf clawed at his belly and tore himself free, rolled, lunged 
for him. Yellow fangs snapped closed on his throat, but he shook off his old grey cousin as he would a 
rat, then charged after him, knocked him down. Rolling, ripping, kicking, they fought until the both of 
them were ragged and fresh blood dappled the snows around them. But finally the old one-eyed wolf 
lay down and showed his belly. The direwolf snapped at him twice more, sniffed at his butt, then lifted a 
leg over him. 
A few snaps and a warning growl, and the female and the tail submitted too. The pack was his. 
The prey as well. He went from man to man, sniffing, before settling on the biggest, a faceless 
thing who clutched black iron in one hand. His other hand was missing, severed at the wrist, the stump 
bound up in leather. Blood flowed thick and sluggish from the slash across his throat. The wolf lapped at 
it with his tongue, licked the ragged eyeless ruin of his nose and cheeks, then buried his muzzle in his 
neck and tore it open, gulping down a gobbet of sweet meat. No flesh had ever tasted half as good. 
When he was done with that one, he moved to the next, and devoured the choicest bits of that 
man too. Ravens watched him from the trees, squatting dark-eyed and silent on the branches as snow 
drifted down around them. The other wolves made do with his leavings; the old male fed first, then the 
female, then the tail. They were his now. They were pack. 
No, the boy whispered, we have another pack. Lady’s dead and maybe Grey Wind too, but 
somewhere there’s still Shaggydog and Nymeria and Ghost. Remember Ghost? 
Falling snow and feasting wolves began to dim. Warmth beat against his face, comforting as a 
mother’s kisses. Fire, he thought, smoke. His nose twitched to the smell of roasting meat. And then the 
forest fell away, and he was back in the longhall again, back in his broken body, staring at a fire. Meera 
Reed was turning a chunk of raw red flesh above the flames, letting it char and spit. “Just in time,” she 
said. Bran rubbed his eyes with the heel of his hand and wriggled backwards against the wall to sit. “You 
almost slept through supper. The ranger found a sow.” 
Behind her, Hodor was tearing eagerly at a chunk of hot charred flesh as blood and grease ran 
down into his beard. Wisps of smoke rose from between his fingers. “Hodor,” he muttered between 

bites, “hodor, hodor.” His sword lay on the earthen floor beside him. Jojen Reed nipped at his own joint 
with small bites, chewing each chunk of meat a dozen times before swallowing. 
The ranger killed a pig. Coldhands stood beside the door, a raven on his arm, both staring at the 
fire. Reflections from the flames glittered off four black eyes. He does not eat, Bran remembered, and he 
fears the flames. 
“You said no fire,” he reminded the ranger. “The walls around us hide the light, and dawn is 
close. We will be on our way soon.” 
“What happened to the men? The foes behind us?” 
“They will not trouble you.” 
“Who were they? Wildlings?” 
Meera turned the meat to cook the other side. Hodor was chewing and swallowing, muttering 
happily under his breath. Only Jojen seemed aware of what was happening as Coldhands turned his 
head to stare at Bran. “They were foes.” 
Men of the Night’s Watch. “You killed them. You and the ravens. Their faces were all torn, and 
their eyes were gone.” Coldhands did not deny it. “They were your brothers. I saw. The wolves had 
ripped their clothes up, but I could still tell. Their cloaks were black. Like your hands.” Cold-hands said 
nothing. “Who are you? Why are your hands black?” 
The ranger studied his hands as if he had never noticed them before. “Once the heart has 
ceased to beat, a man’s blood runs down into his extremities, where it thickens and congeals.” His voice 
rattled in his throat, as thin and gaunt as he was. “His hands and feet swell up and turn as black as 
pudding. The rest of him becomes as white as milk.” 
Meera Reed rose, her frog spear in her hand, a chunk of smoking meat still impaled upon its 
tines. “Show us your face.” 
The ranger made no move to obey. 
“He’s dead.” Bran could taste the bile in his throat. “Meera, he’s some dead thing. The monsters 
cannot pass so long as the Wall stands and the men of the Night’s Watch stay true, that’s what Old Nan 
used to say. He came to meet us at the Wall, but he could not pass. He sent Sam instead, with that 
wildling girl.” 
Meera’s gloved hand tightened around the shaft of her frog spear. “Who sent you? Who is this 
three-eyed crow?” 
“A friend. Dreamer, wizard, call him what you will. The last green-seer.” The longhall’s wooden 
door banged open. Outside, the night wind howled, bleak and black. The trees were full of ravens, 
screaming. Cold-hands did not move. 

“A monster,” Bran said. 
The ranger looked at Bran as if the rest of them did not exist. “Your monster, Brandon Stark.” 
“Yours,” the raven echoed, from his shoulder. Outside the door, the ravens in the trees took up 
the cry, until the night wood echoed to the murderer’s song of “Yours, yours, yours.” 
“Jojen, did you dream this?” Meera asked her brother. “Who is he? What is he? What do we do 
now?” 
“We go with the ranger,” said Jojen. “We have come too far to turn back now, Meera. We would 
never make it back to the Wall alive. We go with Bran’s monster, or we die.” 
TYRION 
They departed Pentos by the Sunrise Gate, though Tyrion Lannister never glimpsed the sunrise. 
“It will be as if you had never come to Pentos, my little friend,” promised Magister Illyrio, as he drew 
shut the litter’s purple velvet drapes. “No man must see you leave the city, as no man saw you enter.” 
“No man except the sailors who stuffed me in that barrel, the cabin boy who cleaned up after 
me, the girl you sent to warm my bed, and that treacherous freckled washerwoman. Oh, and your 
guards. Unless you removed their wits along with their balls, they know you’re not alone in here.” The 
litter was suspended between eight mammoth draft horses on heavy leather straps. Four eunuchs paced 
beside the horses, two to either side, and more were trudging along behind to guard the baggage train. 
“Unsullied tell no tales,” Illyrio assured him. “And the galley that delivered you is on her way to 
Asshai even now. It will be two years before she returns, if the seas are kind. As for my household, they 
love me well. None would betray me.” 
Cherish that thought, my fat friend. One day we will carve those words upon your crypt. “We 
should be aboard that galley,” the dwarf said. “The fastest way to Volantis is by sea.” 
“The sea is hazardous,” replied Illyrio. “Autumn is a season rife with storms, and pirates still 
make their dens upon the Stepstones and venture forth to prey on honest men. It would never do for 
my little friend to fall into such hands.” 
“There are pirates on the Rhoyne as well.” 
“River pirates.” The cheesemonger gave a yawn, covering his mouth with the back of his hand. 
“Cockroach captains scurrying after crumbs.” 
“One hears talk of stone men as well.” 

“They are real enough, poor damned things. But why speak of such things? The day is too fine 
for such talk. We shall see the Rhoyne soon, and there you shall be rid of Illyrio and his big belly. Till 
then, let us drink and dream. We have sweet wine and savories to enjoy. Why dwell upon disease and 
death?” 
Why indeed? Tyrion heard the thrum of a crossbow once again, and wondered. The litter 
swayed side to side, a soothing movement that made him feel as if he were a child being rocked to sleep 
in his mother’s arms. Not that I would know what that was like. Silk pillows stuffed with goose down 
cushioned his cheeks. The purple velvet walls curved overhead to form a roof, making it pleasantly 
warm within despite the autumn chill outside. 
A train of mules trailed behind them, carrying chests and casks and barrels, and hampers of 
delectables to keep the lord of cheese from growing peckish. They nibbled on spiced sausage that 
morning, washed down with a dark smokeberry brown. Jellied eels and Dornish reds filled their 
afternoon. Come evening there were sliced hams, boiled eggs, and roasted larks stuffed with garlic and 
onions, with pale ales and Myrish fire wines to help in their digestion. The litter was as slow as it was 
comfortable, however, and the dwarf soon found himself itching with impatience. 
“How many days until we reach the river?” he asked Illyrio that evening. “At this pace, your 
queen’s dragons will be larger than Aegon’s three before I can lay eyes upon them.” 
“Would it were so. A large dragon is more fearsome than a small one.” The magister shrugged. 
“Much as it would please me to welcome Queen Daenerys to Volantis, I must rely on you and Griff for 
that. I can serve her best in Pentos, smoothing the way for her return. So long as I am with you, though 
… well, an old fat man must have his comforts, yes? Come, drink a cup of wine.” 
“Tell me,” Tyrion said as he drank, “why should a magister of Pentos give three figs who wears 
the crown in Westeros? Where is the gain for you in this venture, my lord?” 
The fat man dabbed grease from his lips. “I am an old man, grown weary of this world and its 
treacheries. Is it so strange that I should wish to do some good before my days are done, to help a sweet 
young girl regain her birthright?” 
Next you will be offering me a suit of magic armor and a palace in Valyria. “If Daenerys is no 
more than a sweet young girl, the Iron Throne will cut her into sweet young pieces.” 
“Fear not, my little friend. The blood of Aegon the Dragon flows in her veins.” 
Along with the blood of Aegon the Unworthy, Maegor the Cruel, and Baelor the Befuddled. “Tell 
me more of her.” 
The fat man grew pensive. “Daenerys was half a child when she came to me, yet fairer even 
than my second wife, so lovely I was tempted to claim her for myself. Such a fearful, furtive thing, 
however, I knew I should get no joy from coupling with her. Instead I summoned a bed-warmer and 

fucked her vigorously until the madness passed. If truth be told, I did not think Daenerys would survive 
for long amongst the horselords.” 
“That did not stop you selling her to Khal Drogo …” 
“Dothraki neither buy nor sell. Say rather that her brother Viserys gave her to Drogo to win the 
khal’s friendship. A vain young man, and greedy. Viserys lusted for his father’s throne, but he lusted for 
Daenerys too, and was loath to give her up. The night before the princess wed he tried to steal into her 
bed, insisting that if he could not have her hand, he would claim her maidenhead. Had I not taken the 
precaution of posting guards upon her door, Viserys might have undone years of planning.” 
“He sounds an utter fool.” 
“Viserys was Mad Aerys’s son, just so. Daenerys … Daenerys is quite different.” He popped a 
roasted lark into his mouth and crunched it noisily, bones and all. “The frightened child who sheltered in 
my manse died on the Dothraki sea, and was reborn in blood and fire. This dragon queen who wears her 
name is a true Targaryen. When I sent ships to bring her home, she turned toward Slaver’s Bay. In a 
short span of days she conquered Astapor, made Yunkai bend the knee, and sacked Meereen. Mantarys 
will be next, if she marches west along the old Valyrian roads. If she comes by sea, well … her fleet must 
take on food and water at Volantis.” 
“By land or by sea, there are long leagues between Meereen and Volantis,” Tyrion observed. 
“Five hundred fifty, as the dragon flies, through deserts, mountains, swamps, and 
demon-haunted ruins. Many and more will perish, but those who survive will be stronger by the time 
they reach Volantis … where they shall find you and Griff awaiting them, with fresh forces and sufficient 
ships to carry them all across the sea to Westeros.” 
Tyrion pondered all he knew of Volantis, oldest and proudest of the Nine Free Cities. Something 
was awry here. Even with half a nose, he could smell it. “It’s said there are five slaves for every free man 
in Volantis. Why would the triarchs assist a queen who smashed the slave trade?” He pointed at Illyrio. 
“For that matter, why would you? Slavery may be forbidden by the laws of Pentos, yet you have a finger 
in that trade as well, and maybe a whole hand. And yet you conspire for the dragon queen, and not 
against her. Why? What do you hope to gain from Queen Daenerys?” 
“Are we back to that again? You are a persistent little man.” Illyrio gave a laugh and slapped his 
belly. “As you will. The Beggar King swore that I should be his master of coin, and a lordly lord as well. 
Once he wore his golden crown, I should have my choice of castles … even Casterly Rock, if I desired.” 
Tyrion snorted wine back up the scarred stump that had been his nose. “My father would have 
loved to hear that.” 
“Your lord father had no cause for concern. Why would I want a rock? My manse is large enough 
for any man, and more comfortable than your drafty Westerosi castles. Master of coin, though …” The 

fat man peeled another egg. “I am fond of coins. Is there any sound as sweet as the clink of gold on 
gold?” 
A sister’s screams. “Are you quite certain that Daenerys will make good her brother’s 
promises?” 
“She will, or she will not.” Illyrio bit the egg in half. “I told you, my little friend, not all that a man 
does is done for gain. Believe as you wish, but even fat old fools like me have friends, and debts of 
affection to repay.” 
Liar, thought Tyrion. There is something in this venture worth more to you than coin or castles. 
“You meet so few men who value friendship over gold these days.” 
“Too true,” the fat man said, deaf to the irony. “How is it that the Spider became so dear to 
you?” 
“We were young together, two green boys in Pentos.” 
“Varys came from Myr.” 
“So he did. I met him not long after he arrived, one step ahead of the slavers. By day he slept in 
the sewers, by night he prowled the rooftops like a cat. I was near as poor, a bravo in soiled silks, living 
by my blade. Perhaps you chanced to glimpse the statue by my pool? Pytho Malanon carved that when I 
was six-and-ten. A lovely thing, though now I weep to see it.” 
“Age makes ruins of us all. I am still in mourning for my nose. But Varys …” 
“In Myr he was a prince of thieves, until a rival thief informed on him. In Pentos his accent 
marked him, and once he was known for a eunuch he was despised and beaten. Why he chose me to 
protect him I may never know, but we came to an arrangement. Varys spied on lesser thieves and took 
their takings. I offered my help to their victims, promising to recover their valuables for a fee. Soon 
every man who had suffered a loss knew to come to me, whilst city’s footpads and cutpurses sought out 
Varys … half to slit his throat, the other half to sell him what they’d stolen. We both grew rich, and richer 
still when Varys trained his mice.” 
“In King’s Landing he kept little birds.” 
“Mice, we called them then. The older thieves were fools who thought no further than turning a 
night’s plunder into wine. Varys preferred orphan boys and young girls. He chose the smallest, the ones 
who were quick and quiet, and taught them to climb walls and slip down chimneys. He taught them to 
read as well. We left the gold and gems for common thieves. Instead our mice stole letters, ledgers, 
charts … later, they would read them and leave them where they lay. Secrets are worth more than silver 
or sapphires, Varys claimed. Just so. I grew so respectable that a cousin of the Prince of Pentos let me 
wed his maiden daughter, whilst whispers of a certain eunuch’s talents crossed the narrow sea and 
reached the ears of a certain king. A very anxious king, who did not wholly trust his son, nor his wife, nor 

his Hand, a friend of his youth who had grown arrogant and overproud. I do believe that you know the 
rest of this tale, is that not so?” 
“Much of it,” Tyrion admitted. “I see that you are somewhat more than a cheesemonger after 
all.” 
Illyrio inclined his head. “You are kind to say so, my little friend. And for my part, I see that you 
are just as quick as Lord Varys claimed.” He smiled, showing all his crooked yellow teeth, and shouted 
for another jar of Myrish fire wine. 
When the magister drifted off to sleep with the wine jar at his elbow, Tyrion crept across the 
pillows to work it loose from its fleshy prison and pour himself a cup. He drained it down, and yawned, 
and filled it once again. If I drink enough fire wine, he told himself, perhaps I’ll dream of dragons. 
When he was still a lonely child in the depths of Casterly Rock, he oft rode dragons through the 
nights, pretending he was some lost Targaryen princeling, or a Valyrian dragonlord soaring high o’er 
fields and mountains. Once, when his uncles asked him what gift he wanted for his name-day, he 
begged them for a dragon. “It wouldn’t need to be a big one. It could be little, like I am.” His uncle 
Gerion thought that was the funniest thing he had ever heard, but his uncle Tygett said, “The last dragon 
died a century ago, lad.” That had seemed so monstrously unfair that the boy had cried himself to sleep 
that night. 
Yet if the lord of cheese could be believed, the Mad King’s daughter had hatched three living 
dragons. Two more than even a Targaryen should require. Tyrion was almost sorry that he had killed his 
father. He would have enjoyed seeing Lord Tywin’s face when he learned that there was a Targaryen 
queen on her way to Westeros with three dragons, backed by a scheming eunuch and a cheesemonger 
half the size of Casterly Rock. 
The dwarf was so stuffed that he had to undo his belt and the topmost laces on his breeches. 
The boy’s clothes his host had dressed him in made him feel like ten pounds of sausage in a five-pound 
skin. If we eat this way every day I will be the size of Illyrio before I meet this dragon queen. Out-side the 
litter night had fallen. Inside all was dark. Tyrion listened to Illyrio’s snores, the creak of the leather 
straps, the slow clop clop of the team’s ironshod hooves on the hard Valyrian road, but his heart was 
listening for the beat of leathern wings. 
When he woke, dawn had come. The horses plodded on, the litter creaking and swaying 
between them. Tyrion pulled the curtain back an inch to peer outside, but there was little to see but 
ochre fields, bare brown elms, and the road itself, a broad stone highway that ran straight as a spear to 
the horizon. He had read about Valyrian roads, but this was the first he had seen. The Freehold’s grasp 
had reached as far as Dragonstone, but never to the mainland of Westeros itself. Odd, that. 
Dragonstone is no more than a rock. The wealth was farther west, but they had dragons. Surely they 
knew that it was there. 

He had drunk too much last night. His head was pounding, and even the gentle swaying of the 
litter was enough to make his gorge rise in his throat. Though he said no word of complaint, his distress 
must have been plain to Illyrio Mopatis. “Come, drink with me,” the fat man said. “A scale from the 
dragon that burned you, as they say.” He poured for them from a flagon of blackberry wine so sweet 
that it drew more flies than honey. Tyrion shooed them off with the back of his hand and drank deep. 
The taste was so cloying that it was all he could do to keep it down. The second cup went down easier, 
however. Even so, he had no appetite, and when Illyrio offered him a bowl of blackberries in cream he 
waved it off. “I dreamed about the queen,” he said. “I was on my knees before her, swearing my 
allegiance, but she mistook me for my brother, Jaime, and fed me to her dragons.” 
“Let us hope this dream was not prophetic. You are a clever imp, just as Varys said, and 
Daenerys will have need of clever men about her. Ser Barristan is a valiant knight and true; but none, I 
think, has ever called him cunning.” 
“Knights know only one way to solve a problem. They couch their lances and charge. A dwarf 
has a different way of looking at the world. What of you, though? You are a clever man yourself.” 
“You flatter me.” Illyrio waggled his hand. “Alas, I am not made for travel, so I will send you to 
Daenerys in my stead. You did Her Grace a great service when you slew your father, and it is my hope 
that you will do her many more. Daenerys is not the fool her brother was. She will make good use of 
you.” 
As kindling? Tyrion thought, smiling pleasantly. 
They changed out teams only thrice that day but seemed to halt twice an hour at the least so 
Illyrio could climb down from the litter and have himself a piss. Our lord of cheese is the size of an 
elephant, but he has a bladder like a peanut, the dwarf mused. During one stop, he used the time to 
have a closer look at the road. Tyrion knew what he would find: not packed earth, nor bricks, nor 
cobbles, but a ribbon of fused stone raised a half foot above the ground to allow rainfall and snowmelt 
to run off its shoulders. Unlike the muddy tracks that passed for roads in the Seven Kingdoms, the 
Valyrian roads were wide enough for three wagons to pass abreast, and neither time nor traffic marred 
them. They still endured, unchanging, four centuries after Valyria itself had met its Doom. He looked for 
ruts and cracks but found only a pile of warm dung deposited by one of the horses. 
The dung made him think of his lord father. Are you down in some hell, Father? A nice cold hell 
where you can look up and see me help restore Mad Aerys’s daughter to the Iron Throne? 
As they resumed their journey, Illyrio produced a bag of roasted chestnuts and began to speak 
once more of the dragon queen. “Our last news of Queen Daenerys is old and stale, I fear. By now she 
will have left Meereen, we must assume. She has her host at last, a ragged host of sellswords, Dothraki 
horselords, and Unsullied infantry, and she will no doubt lead them west, to take back her father’s 
throne.” Magister Illyrio twisted open a pot of garlic snails, sniffed at them, and smiled. “At Volantis, you 
will have fresh tidings of Daenerys, we must hope,” he said, as he sucked one from its shell. “Dragons 

and young girls are both capricious, and it may be that you will need to adjust your plans. Griff will know 
what to do. Will you have a snail? The garlic is from my own gardens.” 
I could ride a snail and make a better pace than this litter of yours. Tyrion waved the dish away. 
“You place a deal of trust in this man Griff. Another friend of your childhood?” 
“No. A sellsword, you would call him, but Westerosi born. Daenerys needs men worthy of her 
cause.” Illyrio raised a hand. “I know! ‘Sellswords put gold before honor,’ you are thinking. ‘This man 
Griff will sell me to my sister.’ Not so. I trust Griff as I would trust a brother.” 
Another mortal error. “Then I shall do likewise.” 
“The Golden Company marches toward Volantis as we speak, there to await the coming of our 
queen out of the east.” 
Beneath the gold, the bitter steel. “I had heard the Golden Company was under contract with 
one of the Free Cities.” 
“Myr.” Illyrio smirked. “Contracts can be broken.” 
“There is more coin in cheese than I knew,” said Tyrion. “How did you accomplish that?” 
The magister waggled his fat fingers. “Some contracts are writ in ink, and some in blood. I say no 
more.” 
The dwarf pondered that. The Golden Company was reputedly the finest of the free companies, 
founded a century ago by Bittersteel, a bastard son of Aegon the Unworthy. When another of Aegon’s 
Great Bastards tried to seize the Iron Throne from his trueborn half-brother, Bittersteel joined the 
revolt. Daemon Blackfyre had perished on the Redgrass Field, however, and his rebellion with him. 
Those followers of the Black Dragon who survived the battle yet refused to bend the knee fled across 
the narrow sea, among them Daemon’s younger sons, Bittersteel, and hundreds of landless lords and 
knights who soon found themselves forced to sell their swords to eat. Some joined the Ragged Standard, 
some the Second Sons or Maiden’s Men. Bittersteel saw the strength of House Blackfyre scattering to 
the four winds, so he formed the Golden Company to bind the exiles together. 
From that day to this, the men of the Golden Company had lived and died in the Disputed Lands, 
fighting for Myr or Lys or Tyrosh in their pointless little wars, and dreaming of the land their fathers had 
lost. They were exiles and sons of exiles, dispossessed and unforgiven … yet formidable fighters still. 
“I admire your powers of persuasion,” Tyrion told Illyrio. “How did you convince the Golden 
Company to take up the cause of our sweet queen when they have spent so much of their history 
fighting against the Targaryens?” 
Illyrio brushed away the objection as if it were a fly. “Black or red, a dragon is still a dragon. 
When Maelys the Monstrous died upon the Stepstones, it was the end of the male line of House 

Blackfyre.” The cheesemonger smiled through his forked beard. “And Daenerys will give the exiles what 
Bittersteel and the Blackfyres never could. She will take them home.” 
With fire and sword. It was the kind of homecoming that Tyrion wished for as well. “Ten 
thousand swords makes for a princely gift, I grant you. Her Grace should be most pleased.” 
The magister gave a modest bob of his head, chins jiggling. “I would never presume to say what 
might please Her Grace.” 
Prudent of you. Tyrion knew much and more about the gratitude of kings. Why should queens 
be any different? 
Soon enough the magister was fast asleep, leaving Tyrion to brood alone. He wondered what 
Barristan Selmy would think of riding into battle with the Golden Company. During the War of the 
Ninepenny Kings, Selmy had cut a bloody path through their ranks to slay the last of the Blackfyre 
Pretenders. Rebellion makes for queer bedfellows. And none more queer than this fat man and me. 
The cheesemonger woke when they stopped to change the horses and sent for a fresh hamper. 
“How far have we come?” the dwarf asked him as they stuffed themselves with cold capon and a relish 
made of carrots, raisins, and bits of lime and orange. 
“This is Andalos, my friend. The land your Andals came from. They took it from the hairy men 
who were here before them, cousins to the hairy men of Ib. The heart of Hugor’s ancient realm lies 
north of us, but we are passing through its southern marches. In Pentos, these are called the Flatlands. 
Farther east stand the Velvet Hills, whence we are bound.” 
Andalos. The Faith taught that the Seven themselves had once walked the hills of Andalos in 
human form. “The Father reached his hand into the heavens and pulled down seven stars,” Tyrion 
recited from memory, “and one by one he set them on the brow of Hugor of the Hill to make a glowing 
crown.” 
Magister Illyrio gave him a curious look. “I did not dream my little friend was so devout.” 
The dwarf shrugged. “A relic of my boyhood. I knew I would not make a knight, so I decided to 
be High Septon. That crystal crown adds a foot to a man’s height. I studied the holy books and prayed 
until I had scabs on both my knees, but my quest came to a tragic end. I reached that certain age and fell 
in love.” 
“A maiden? I know the way of that.” Illyrio thrust his right hand up his left sleeve and drew out a 
silver locket. Inside was a painted likeness of a woman with big blue eyes and pale golden hair streaked 
by silver. “Serra. I found her in a Lysene pillow house and brought her home to warm my bed, but in the 
end I wed her. Me, whose first wife had been a cousin of the Prince of Pentos. The palace gates were 
closed to me thereafter, but I did not care. The price was small enough, for Serra.” 

“How did she die?” Tyrion knew that she was dead; no man spoke so fondly of a woman who 
had abandoned him. 
“A Braavosi trading galley called at Pentos on her way back from the Jade Sea. The Treasure 
carried cloves and saffron, jet and jade, scarlet samite, green silk … and the grey death. We slew her 
oarsmen as they came ashore and burned the ship at anchor, but the rats crept down the oars and 
paddled to the quay on cold stone feet. The plague took two thousand before it ran its course.” 
Magister Illyrio closed the locket. “I keep her hands in my bedchamber. Her hands that were so soft …” 
Tyrion thought of Tysha. He glanced out at the fields where once the gods had walked. “What 
sort of gods make rats and plagues and dwarfs?” Another passage from The Seven-Pointed Star came 
back to him. “The Maid brought him forth a girl as supple as a willow with eyes like deep blue pools, and 
Hugor declared that he would have her for his bride. So the Mother made her fertile, and the Crone 
foretold that she would bear the king four-and-forty mighty sons. The Warrior gave strength to their 
arms, whilst the Smith wrought for each a suit of iron plates.” 
“Your Smith must have been Rhoynish,” Illyrio quipped. “The Andals learned the art of working 
iron from the Rhoynar who dwelt along the river. This is known.” 
“Not by our septons.” Tyrion gestured at the fields. “Who dwells in these Flatlands of yours?” 
“Tillers and toilers, bound to the land. There are orchards, farms, mines … I own some such 
myself, though I seldom visit them. Why should I spend my days out here, with the myriad delights of 
Pentos close at hand?” 
“Myriad delights.” And huge thick walls. Tyrion swirled his wine in his cup. “We have seen no 
towns since Pentos.” 
“There are ruins.” Illyrio waved a chicken leg toward the curtains. “The horselords come this 
way, whenever some khal takes it into his head to gaze upon the sea. The Dothraki are not fond of 
towns, you will know this even in Westeros.” 
“Fall upon one of these khalasars and destroy it, and you may find that the Dothraki are not so 
quick to cross the Rhoyne.” 
“It is cheaper to buy off foes with food and gifts.” 
If only I had thought to bring a nice cheese to the battle on the Blackwater, I might still have all 
my nose. Lord Tywin had always held the Free Cities in contempt. They fight with coins instead of 
swords, he used to say. Gold has its uses, but wars are won with iron. “Give gold to a foe and he will just 
come back for more, my father always said.” 
“Is this the selfsame father that you murdered?” Illyrio tossed his chicken bone from the litter. 
“Sellswords will not stand against Dothraki screamers. That was proved at Qohor.” 

“Not even your brave Griff?” mocked Tyrion. “Griff is different. He has a son he dotes on. Young 
Griff, the boy is called. There never was a nobler lad.” 
The wine, the food, the sun, the sway of the litter, the buzzing of the flies, all conspired to make 
Tyrion sleepy. So he slept, woke, drank. Illyrio matched him cup for cup. And as the sky turned a dusky 
purple, the fat man began to snore. 
That night Tyrion Lannister dreamed of a battle that turned the hills of Westeros as red as blood. 
He was in the midst of it, dealing death with an axe as big as he was, fighting side by side with Barristan 
the Bold and Bittersteel as dragons wheeled across the sky above them. In the dream he had two heads, 
both noseless. His father led the enemy, so he slew him once again. Then he killed his brother, Jaime, 
hacking at his face until it was a red ruin, laughing every time he struck a blow. Only when the fight was 
finished did he realize that his second head was weeping. 
When he woke his stunted legs were stiff as iron. Illyrio was eating olives. “Where are we?” 
Tyrion asked him. 
“We have not yet left the Flatlands, my hasty friend. Soon our road shall pass into the Velvet 
Hills. There we begin our climb toward Ghoyan Drohe, upon the Little Rhoyne.” 
Ghoyan Drohe had been a Rhoynar city, until the dragons of Valyria had reduced it to a 
smoldering desolation. I am traveling through years as well as leagues, Tyrion reflected, back through 
history to the days when dragons ruled the earth. 
Tyrion slept and woke and slept again, and day and night seemed not to matter. The Velvet Hills 
proved a disappointment. “Half the whores in Lannisport have breasts bigger than these hills,” he told 
Illyrio. “You ought to call them the Velvet Teats.” They saw a circle of standing stones that Illyrio claimed 
had been raised by giants, and later a deep lake. “Here lived a den of robbers who preyed on all who 
passed this way,” Illyrio said. “It is said they still dwell beneath the water. Those who fish the lake are 
pulled under and devoured.” The next evening they came upon a huge Valyrian sphinx crouched beside 
the road. It had a dragon’s body and a woman’s face. 
“A dragon queen,” said Tyrion. “A pleasant omen.” 
“Her king is missing.” Illyrio pointed out the smooth stone plinth on which the second sphinx 
once stood, now grown over with moss and flowering vines. “The horselords built wooden wheels 
beneath him and dragged him back to Vaes Dothrak.” 
That is an omen too, thought Tyrion, but not as hopeful. That night, drunker than usual, he 
broke into sudden song. 
He rode through the streets of the city, down from his hill on high, 
O’er the wynds and the steps and the cobbles, he rode to a woman’s sigh. 
For she was his secret treasure, she was his shame and his bliss. 

And a chain and a keep are nothing, compared to a woman’s kiss. 
Those were all the words he knew, aside from the refrain. Hands of gold are always cold, but a 
woman’s hands are warm. Shae’s hands had beat at him as the golden hands dug into her throat. He did 
not remember if they’d been warm or not. As the strength went out of her, her blows became moths 
fluttering about his face. Each time he gave the chain another twist the golden hands dug deeper. A 
chain and a keep are nothing, compared to a woman’s kiss. Had he kissed her one last time, after she 
was dead? He could not remember … though he still recalled the first time they had kissed, in his tent 
beside the Green Fork. How sweet her mouth had tasted. 
He remembered the first time with Tysha as well. She did not know how, no more than I did. We 
kept bumping our noses, but when I touched her tongue with mine she trembled. Tyrion closed his eyes 
to bring her face to mind, but instead he saw his father, squatting on a privy with his bed-robe hiked up 
about his waist. “Wherever whores go,” Lord Tywin said, and the crossbow thrummed. 
The dwarf rolled over, pressing half a nose deep into the silken pillows. Sleep opened beneath 
him like a well, and he threw himself into it with a will and let the darkness eat him up. 
THE MERCHANT’S MAN 
Adventure stank. 
She boasted sixty oars, a single sail, and a long lean hull that promised speed. Small, but she 
might serve, Quentyn thought when he saw her, but that was before he went aboard and got a good 
whiff of her. Pigs, was his first thought, but after a second sniff he changed his mind. Pigs had a cleaner 
smell. This stink was piss and rotting meat and night-soil, this was the reek of corpse flesh and weeping 
sores and wounds gone bad, so strong that it overwhelmed the salt air and fish smell of the harbor. 
“I want to retch,” he said to Gerris Drinkwater. They were waiting for the ship’s master to 
appear, sweltering in the heat as the stench wafted up from the deck beneath them. 
“If the captain smells anything like his ship, he may mistake your vomit for perfume,” Gerris 
replied. 
Quentyn was about to suggest that they try another ship when the master finally made his 
appearance, with two vile-looking crewmen at his side. Gerris greeted him with a smile. Though he did 
not speak the Volantene tongue as well as Quentyn, their ruse required that he speak for them. Back in 
the Planky Town Quentyn had played the wineseller, but the mummery had chafed at him, so when the 
Dornishmen changed ships at Lys they had changed roles as well. Aboard the Meadowlark, Cletus 
Yronwood became the merchant, Quentyn the servant; in Volantis, with Cletus slain, Gerris had 
assumed the master’s role. 

Tall and fair, with blue-green eyes, sandy hair streaked by the sun, and a lean and comely body, 
Gerris Drinkwater had a swagger to him, a confidence bordering on arrogance. He never seemed ill at 
ease, and even when he did not speak the language, he had ways of making himself understood. 
Quentyn cut a poor figure by comparison— short-legged and stocky, thickly built, with hair the brown of 
new-turned earth. His forehead was too high, his jaw too square, his nose too broad. A good honest 
face, a girl had called it once, but you should smile more. 
Smiles had never come easily for Quentyn Martell, any more than they did for his lord father. 
“How swift is your Adventure?” Gerris said, in a halting approximation of High Valyrian. 
The Adventure’s master recognized the accent and responded in the Common Tongue of 
Westeros. “There is none swifter, honored lord. Adventure can run down the wind itself. Tell me where 
you wish to sail, and swiftly I shall bring you there.” 
“I seek passage to Meereen for myself and two servants.” 
That gave the captain pause. “I am no stranger to Meereen. I could find the city again, aye … but 
why? There are no slaves to be had in Meereen, no profit to be found there. The silver queen has put an 
end to that. She has even closed the fighting pits, so a poor sailor cannot even amuse himself as he waits 
to fill his holds. Tell me, my Westerosi friend, what is there in Meereen that you should want to go 
there?” 
The most beautiful woman in the world, thought Quentyn. My bride-to-be, if the gods are good. 
Sometimes at night he lay awake imagining her face and form, and wondering why such a woman would 
ever want to marry him, of all the princes in the world. I am Dorne, he told himself. She will want Dorne. 
Gerris answered with the tale they had concocted. “Wine is our family trade. My father owns 
extensive vineyards back in Dorne, and wishes me to find new markets. It is hoped that the good folk of 
Meereen will welcome what I sell.” 
“Wine? Dornish wine?” The captain was not convinced. “The slave cities are at war. Can it be 
you do not know this?” 
“The fighting is between Yunkai and Astapor, we had heard. Meereen is not involved.” 
“Not as yet. But soon. An envoy from the Yellow City is in Volantis even now, hiring swords. The 
Long Lances have already taken ship for Yunkai, and the Windblown and the Company of the Cat will 
follow once they have finished filling out their ranks. The Golden Company marches east as well. All this 
is known.” 
“If you say so. I deal in wine, not wars. Ghiscari wine is poor stuff, all agree. The Meereenese will 
pay a good price for my fine Dornish vintages.” 
“Dead men do not care what kind of wine they drink.” The master of Adventure fingered his 
beard. “I am not the first captain you have approached, I think. Nor the tenth.” 

“No,” Gerris admitted. 
“How many, then? A hundred?” 
Close enough, thought Quentyn. The Volantenes were fond of boasting that the hundred isles of 
Braavos could be dropped into their deep harbor and drowned. Quentyn had never seen Braavos, but he 
could believe it. Rich and ripe and rotted, Volantis covered the mouth of the Rhoyne like a warm wet 
kiss, stretching across hill and marsh on both sides of the river. Ships were everywhere, coming down 
the river or headed out to sea, crowding the wharves and piers, taking on cargo or off-loading it: 
warships and whalers and trading galleys, carracks and skiffs, cogs, great cogs, long-ships, swan ships, 
ships from Lys and Tyrosh and Pentos, Qartheen spicers big as palaces, ships from Tolos and Yunkai and 
the Basilisks. So many that Quentyn, seeing the port for the first time from the deck of the Meadowlark, 
had told his friends that they would only linger here three days. 
Yet twenty days had passed, and here they remained, still shipless. The captains of the 
Melantine, the Triarch’s Daughter, and the Mermaid’s Kiss had all refused them. A mate on the Bold 
Voyager had laughed in their faces. The master of the Dolphin berated them for wasting his time, and 
the owner of the Seventh Son accused them of being pirates. All on the first day. 
Only the captain of the Fawn had given them reasons for his refusal. “It is true that I am sailing 
east,” he told them, over watered wine. “South around Valyria and thence into the sunrise. We will take 
on water and provisions at New Ghis, then bend all oars toward Qarth and the Jade Gates. Every voyage 
has perils, long ones more than most. Why should I seek out more danger by turning into Slaver’s Bay? 
The Fawn is my livelihood. I will not risk her to take three mad Dornishmen into the middle of a war.” 
Quentyn had begun to think that they might have done better to buy their own ship in the 
Planky Town. That would have drawn unwanted attention, however. The Spider had informers 
everywhere, even in the halls of Sunspear. “Dorne will bleed if your purpose is discovered,” his father 
had warned him, as they watched the children frolic in the pools and fountains of the Water Gardens. 
“What we do is treason, make no mistake. Trust only your companions, and do your best to avoid 
attracting notice.” 
So Gerris Drinkwater gave the captain of Adventure his most disarming smile. “Truth be told, I 
have not kept count of all the cowards who refused us, but at the Merchant’s House I heard it said that 
you were a bolder sort of man, the sort who might risk anything for sufficient gold.” 
A smuggler, Quentyn thought. That was how the other traders styled Adventure’s master, back 
at the Merchant’s House. “He is a smuggler and a slaver, half pirate and half pander, but it may be that 
he is your best hope,” the innkeep had told them. 
The captain rubbed thumb and forefinger together. “And how much gold would you deem 
sufficient for such a voyage?” 
“Thrice your usual fee for passage to Slaver’s Bay.” 

“For each of you?” The captain showed his teeth in something that might have been intended as 
a smile though it gave his narrow face a feral look. “Perhaps. It is true, I am a bolder man than most. 
How soon will you wish to leave?” 
“The morrow would not be too soon.” 
“Done. Return an hour before first light, with your friends and your wines. Best to be under way 
whilst Volantis sleeps, so no one will ask us inconvenient questions about our destination.” 
“As you say. An hour before first light.” 
The captain’s smile widened. “I am pleased that I can help you. We will have a happy voyage, 
yes?” 
“I am certain of it,” said Gerris. The captain called for ale then, and the two of them drank a 
toast to their venture. 
“A sweet man,” Gerris said afterward, as he and Quentyn made their way down to the foot of 
the pier where their hired hathay waited. The air hung hot and heavy, and the sun was so bright that 
both of them were squinting. 
“This is a sweet city,” Quentyn agreed. Sweet enough to rot your teeth. Sweet beets were grown 
in profusion hereabouts, and were served with almost every meal. The Volantenes made a cold soup of 
them, as thick and rich as purple honey. Their wines were sweet as well. “I fear our happy voyage will be 
short, however. That sweet man does not mean to take us to Meereen. He was too quick to accept your 
offer. He’ll take thrice the usual fee, no doubt, and once he has us aboard and out of sight of land, he’ll 
slit our throats and take the rest of our gold as well.” 
“Or chain us to an oar, beside those wretches we were smelling. We need to find a better class 
of smuggler, I think.” 
Their driver awaited them beside his hathay. In Westeros, it might have been called an oxcart, 
though it was a deal more ornate than any cart that Quentyn had ever seen in Dorne, and lacked an ox. 
The hathay was pulled by a dwarf elephant, her hide the color of dirty snow. The streets of Old Volantis 
were full of such. 
Quentyn would have preferred to walk, but they were miles from their inn. Besides, the innkeep 
at the Merchant’s House had warned him that traveling afoot would taint them in the eyes of foreign 
captains and the native-born Volantenes alike. Persons of quality traveled by palanquin, or in the back of 
a hathay … and as it happened the innkeep had a cousin who owned several such contrivances and 
would be pleased to serve them in this matter. 
Their driver was one of the cousin’s slaves, a small man with a wheel tattooed upon one cheek, 
naked but for a breechclout and a pair of sandals. His skin was the color of teak, his eyes chips of flint. 
After he had helped them up onto the cushioned bench between the cart’s two huge wooden wheels, 

he clambered onto the elephant’s back. “The Merchant’s House,” Quentyn told him, “but go along the 
wharves.” Beyond the waterfront and its breezes, the streets and alleys of Volantis were hot enough to 
drown a man in his own sweat, at least on this side of the river. 
The driver shouted something at his elephant in the local tongue. The beast began to move, 
trunk swaying from side to side. The cart lurched along behind her, the driver hooting at sailors and 
slaves alike to clear the way. It was easy enough to tell one from the other. The slaves were all tattooed: 
a mask of blue feathers, a lightning bolt that ran from jaw to brow, a coin upon the cheek, a leopard’s 
spots, a skull, a jug. Maester Kedry said there were five slaves for every free man in Volantis though he 
had not lived long enough to verify his estimate. He had perished on the morning the corsairs swarmed 
aboard the Meadowlark. 
Quentyn lost two other friends that same day—Willam Wells with his freckles and his crooked 
teeth, fearless with a lance, and Cletus Yron-wood, handsome despite his lazy eye, always randy, always 
laughing. Cletus had been Quentyn’s dearest friend for half his life, a brother in all but blood. “Give your 
bride a kiss for me,” Cletus had whispered to him, just before he died. 
The corsairs had come aboard in the darkness before the dawn, as the Meadowlark was 
anchored off the coast of the Disputed Lands. The crew had beaten them off, at the cost of twelve lives. 
Afterward the sailors stripped the dead corsairs of boots and belts and weapons, divvied up their purses, 
and yanked gemstones from their ears and rings from their fingers. One of the corpses was so fat that 
the ship’s cook had to cut his fingers off with a meat cleaver to claim his rings. It took three 
Meadowlarks to roll the body into the sea. The other pirates were chucked in after him, without a word 
of prayer or ceremony. 
Their own dead received more tender treatment. The sailors sewed their bodies up in canvas, 
weighed down with ballast stones so they might sink more quickly. The captain of the Meadowlark led 
his crew in a prayer for the souls of their slain shipmates. Then he turned to his Dornish passengers, the 
three who still remained of the six who had come aboard at the Planky Town. Even the big man had 
emerged, pale and greensick and unsteady on his feet, struggling up from the depths of the ship’s hold 
to pay his last respects. “One of you should say some words for your dead, before we give them to the 
sea,” the captain said. Gerris had obliged, lying with every other word, since he dare not tell the truth of 
who they’d been or why they’d come. 
It was not supposed to end like that for them. “This will be a tale to tell our grandchildren,” 
Cletus had declared the day they set out from his father’s castle. Will made a face at that, and said, “A 
tale to tell tavern wenches, you mean, in hopes they’ll lift their skirts.” Cletus had slapped him on the 
back. “For grandchildren, you need children. For children, you need to lift some skirts.” Later, in the 
Planky Town, the Dornishmen had toasted Quentyn’s future bride, made ribald japes about his wedding 
night to come, and talked about the things they’d see, the deeds they’d do, the glory they would win. All 
they won was a sailcloth sack filled with ballast stones. 
As much as he mourned Will and Cletus, it was the maester’s loss that Quentyn felt most keenly. 
Kedry had been fluent in the tongues of all of the Free Cities, and even the mongrel Ghiscari that men 

spoke along the shores of Slaver’s Bay. “Maester Kedry will accompany you,” his father said the night 
they parted. “Heed his counsel. He has devoted half his life to the study of the Nine Free Cities.” 
Quentyn wondered if things might not have gone a deal easier if only he were here to guide them. 
“I would sell my mother for a bit of breeze,” said Gerris, as they rolled through the dockside 
throngs. “It’s moist as the Maiden’s cunt, and still shy of noon. I hate this city.” 
Quentyn shared the feeling. The sullen wet heat of Volantis sapped his strength and left him 
feeling dirty. The worst part was knowing that nightfall would bring no relief. Up in the high meadows 
north of Lord Yronwood’s estates, the air was always crisp and cool after dark, no matter how hot the 
day had been. Not here. In Volantis, the nights were almost as hot as the days. 
“The Goddess sails for New Ghis on the morrow,” Gerris reminded him. “That at least would 
bring us closer.” 
“New Ghis is an island, and a much smaller port than this. We would be closer, yes, but we could 
find ourselves stranded. And New Ghis has allied with the Yunkai’i.” That news had not come as a 
surprise to Quentyn. New Ghis and Yunkai were both Ghiscari cities. “If Volantis should ally with them as 
well—” 
“We need to find a ship from Westeros,” suggested Gerris, “some trader out of Lannisport or 
Oldtown.” 
“Few come this far, and those who do fill their holds with silk and spice from the Jade Sea, then 
bend their oars for home.” 
“Perhaps a Braavosi ship? One hears of purple sails as far away as Asshai and the islands of the 
Jade Sea.” 
“The Braavosi are descended from escaped slaves. They do not trade in Slaver’s Bay.” 
“Do we have enough gold to buy a ship?” 
“And who will sail her? You? Me?” Dornishmen had never been seafarers, not since Nymeria 
burned her ten thousand ships. “The seas around Valyria are perilous, and thick with corsairs.” 
“I have had enough of corsairs. Let’s not buy a ship.” 
This is still just a game to him, Quentyn realized, no different than the time he led six of us up 
into the mountains to find the old lair of the Vulture King. It was not in Gerris Drinkwater’s nature to 
imagine they might fail, let alone that they might die. Even the deaths of three friends had not served to 
chasten him, it would seem. He leaves that to me. He knows my nature is as cautious as his is bold. 
“Perhaps the big man is right,” Ser Gerris said. “Piss on the sea, we can finish the journey 
overland.” 

“You know why he says that,” Quentyn said. “He’d rather die than set foot on another ship.” The 
big man had been greensick every day of their voyage. In Lys, it had taken him four days to recover his 
strength. They’d had to take rooms in an inn so Maester Kedry could tuck him into a feather bed and 
feed him broths and potions until some pink returned to his cheeks. 
It was possible to go overland to Meereen, that much was true. The old Valyrian roads would 
take them there. Dragon roads, men called the great stone roadways of the Freehold, but the one that 
ran eastward from Volantis to Meereen had earned a more sinister name: the demon road. 
“The demon road is dangerous, and too slow,” Quentyn said. “Tywin Lannister will send his own 
men after the queen once word of her reaches King’s Landing.” His father had been certain of that. “His 
will come with knives. If they reach her first—” 
“Let’s hope her dragons will sniff them out and eat them,” said Gerris. “Well, if we cannot find a 
ship, and you will not let us ride, we had as well book passage back to Dorne.” 
Crawl back to Sunspear defeated, with my tail between my legs? His father’s disappointment 
would be more than Quentyn could bear, and the scorn of the Sand Snakes would be withering. Doran 
Martell had put the fate of Dorne into his hands, he could not fail him, not whilst life remained. 
Heat shimmers rose off the street as the hathay rattled and jounced along on its iron-rimmed 
wheels, giving a dreamlike quality to their surroundings. In amongst the warehouses and the wharves, 
shops and stalls of many sorts crowded the waterfront. Here fresh oysters could be bought, here iron 
chains and manacles, here cyvasse pieces carved of ivory and jade. Here were temples too, where sailors 
came to sacrifice to foreign gods, cheek by jowl with pillow houses where women called down from 
balconies to men below. “Have a look at that one,” Gerris urged, as they passed one pillow house. “I 
think she’s in love with you.” 
And how much does a whore’s love cost? Truth be told, girls made Quentyn anxious, especially 
the pretty ones. 
When first he’d come to Yronwood, he had been smitten with Ynys, the eldest of Lord 
Yronwood’s daughters. Though he never said a word about his feelings, he nursed his dreams for years 
… until the day she was dispatched to wed Ser Ryon Allyrion, the heir to Godsgrace. The last time he had 
seen her, she’d had one boy at her breast and another clinging to her skirts. 
After Ynys had come the Drinkwater twins, a pair of tawny young maidens who loved hawking, 
hunting, climbing rocks, and making Quentyn blush. One of them had given him his first kiss, though he 
never knew which one. As daughters of a landed knight, the twins were too lowborn to marry, but 
Cletus did not think that was any reason to stop kissing them. “After you’re wed you can take one of 
them for a paramour. Or both, why not?” But Quentyn thought of several reasons why not, so he had 
done his best to avoid the twins thereafter, and there had been no second kiss. 
More recently, the youngest of Lord Yronwood’s daughters had taken to following him about 
the castle. Gwyneth was but twelve, a small, scrawny girl whose dark eyes and brown hair set her apart 

in that house of blue-eyed blondes. She was clever, though, as quick with words as with her hands, and 
fond of telling Quentyn that he had to wait for her to flower, so she could marry him. 
That was before Prince Doran had summoned him to the Water Gardens. And now the most 
beautiful woman in the world was waiting in Meereen, and he meant to do his duty and claim her for his 
bride. She will not refuse me. She will honor the agreement. Daenerys Targaryen would need Dorne to 
win the Seven Kingdoms, and that meant that she would need him. It does not mean that she will love 
me, though. She may not even like me. 
The street curved where the river met the sea, and there along the bend a number of animal 
sellers were clustered together, offering jeweled lizards, giant banded snakes, and agile little monkeys 
with striped tails and clever pink hands. “Perhaps your silver queen would like a monkey,” said Gerris. 
Quentyn had no idea what Daenerys Targaryen might like. He had promised his father that he 
would bring her back to Dorne, but more and more he wondered if he was equal to the task. 
I never asked for this, he thought. 
Across the wide blue expanse of the Rhoyne, he could see the Black Wall that had been raised 
by the Valyrians when Volantis was no more than an outpost of their empire: a great oval of fused stone 
two hundred feet high and so thick that six four-horse chariots could race around its top abreast, as they 
did each year to celebrate the founding of the city. Outlanders, foreigners, and freedmen were not 
allowed inside the Black Wall save at the invitation of those who dwelt within, scions of the Old Blood 
who could trace their ancestry back to Valyria itself. 
The traffic was thicker here. They were near the western end of the Long Bridge, which linked 
the two halves of the city. Wayns and carts and hathays crowded the streets, all of them coming from 
the bridge or making for it. Slaves were everywhere, as numerous as roaches, scurrying about their 
masters’ business. 
Not far from Fishermonger’s Square and the Merchant’s House, shouts erupted from a cross 
street, and a dozen Unsullied spearmen in ornate armor and tiger-skin cloaks appeared as if from 
nowhere, waving everyone aside so the triarch could pass through atop his elephant. The triarch’s 
elephant was a grey-skinned behemoth clad in elaborate enameled armor that clattered softly as he 
moved, the castle on its back so tall that it scraped the top of the ornamental stone arch he was passing 
underneath. “The triarchs are considered so elevated that their feet are not allowed to touch the 
ground during their year of service,” Quentyn informed his companion. “They ride everywhere on 
elephants.” 
“Blocking up the streets and leaving heaps of dung for the likes of us to contend with,” said 
Gerris. “Why Volantis needs three princes when Dorne makes do with one, I will never know.” 
“The triarchs are neither kings nor princes. Volantis is a freehold, like Valyria of old. All freeborn 
landholders share the rule. Even women are allowed to vote, provided they own land. The three triarchs 
are chosen from amongst those noble families who can prove unbroken descent from old Valyria, to 

serve until the first day of the new year. And you would know all this if you had troubled to read the 
book that Maester Kedry gave you.” 
“It had no pictures.” 
“There were maps.” 
“Maps do not count. If he had told me it was about tigers and elephants, I might have given it a 
try. It looked suspiciously like a history.” 
When their hathay reached the edge of the Fishermonger’s Square, their elephant lifted her 
trunk and made a honking noise like some huge white goose, reluctant to plunge into the tangle of 
wayns, palanquins, and foot traffic ahead. Their driver prodded her with his heel and kept her moving. 
The fishmongers were out in strength, crying the morning catch. Quentyn understood one word 
in two at best, but he did not need to know the words to know the fish. He saw cod and sailfish and 
sardines, barrels of mussels and clams. Eels hung along the front of one stall. Another displayed a 
gigantic turtle, strung up by its legs on iron chains, heavy as a horse. Crabs scrabbled inside casks of 
brine and seaweed. Several of the vendors were frying chunks of fish with onions and beets, or selling 
peppery fish stew out of small iron kettles. 
In the center of the square, under the cracked and headless statue of a dead triarch, a crowd 
had begun to gather about some dwarfs putting on a show. The little men were done up in wooden 
armor, miniature knights preparing for a joust. Quentyn saw one mount a dog, as the other hopped onto 
a pig … only to slide right off again, to a smattering of laughter. 
“They look amusing,” Gerris said. “Shall we stop and watch them fight? A laugh might serve you 
well, Quent. You look like an old man who has not moved his bowels in half a year.” 
I am eight-and-ten, six years younger than you, Quentyn thought. I am no old man. Instead he 
said, “I have no need for comic dwarfs. Unless they have a ship.” 
“A small one, I would think.” 
Four stories tall, the Merchant’s House dominated the docks and wharves and storehouses that 
surrounded it. Here traders from Oldtown and King’s Landing mingled with their counterparts from 
Braavos and Pentos and Myr, with hairy Ibbenese, pale-skinned voyagers from Qarth, coal-black 
Summer Islanders in feathered cloaks, even masked shadow-binders from Asshai by the Shadow. 
The paving stones felt warm beneath his feet when Quentyn climbed down from the hathay, 
even through the leather of his boots. Outside the Merchant’s House a trestle table had been set up in 
the shade and decorated with striped blue-and-white pennons that fluttered at every breath of air. Four 
hard-eyed sellswords lounged around the table, calling out to every passing man and boy. Windblown, 
Quentyn knew. The serjeants were looking for fresh meat to fill their ranks before they sailed for 

Slaver’s Bay. And every man who signs with them is another sword for Yunkai, another blade meant to 
drink the blood of my bride-to-be. 
One of the Windblown shouted at them. “I do not speak your tongue,” Quentyn answered. 
Though he could read and write High Valyrian, he had little practice speaking it. And the Volantene 
apple had rolled a fair distance from the Valyrian tree. 
“Westerosi?” the man answered, in the Common Tongue. “Dornishmen. My master is a 
wineseller.” 
“Master? Fuck that. Are you a slave? Come with us and be your own master. Do you want to die 
abed? We’ll teach you sword and spear. You’ll ride to battle with the Tattered Prince and come home 
richer than a lord. Boys, girls, gold, whatever you want, if you’re man enough to take it. We’re the 
Windblown, and we fuck the goddess slaughter up her arse.” 
Two of the sellswords began to sing, bellowing out the words to some marching song. Quentyn 
understood enough to get the gist. We are the Windblown, they sang. Blow us east to Slaver’s Bay, we’ll 
kill the butcher king and fuck the dragon queen. 
“If Cletus and Will were still with us, we could come back with the big man and kill the lot of 
them,” said Gerris. 
Cletus and Will are dead. “Pay them no mind,” Quentyn said. The sellswords threw taunts at 
their backs as they pushed through the doors of the Merchant’s House, mocking them as bloodless 
cravens and frightened girls. 
The big man was waiting in their rooms on the second floor. Though the inn had come well 
recommended by the master of the Meadowlark, that did not mean Quentyn was willing to leave their 
goods and gold unguarded. Every port had thieves, rats, and whores, and Volantis had more than most. 
“I was about to go out looking for you,” Ser Archibald Yronwood said as he slid the bar back to 
admit them. It was his cousin Cletus who had started calling him the big man, but the name was well 
deserved. Arch was six-and-a-half-feet tall, broad of shoulder, huge of belly, with legs like tree trunks, 
hands the size of hams, and no neck to speak of. Some childhood malady had made all his hair fall out. 
His bald head reminded Quentyn of a smooth pink boulder. “So,” he demanded, “what did the smuggler 
say? Do we have a boat?” 
“A ship,” corrected Quentyn. “Aye, he’ll take us, but only as far as the nearest hell.” 
Gerris sat upon a sagging bed and pulled off his boots. “Dorne is sounding more attractive every 
moment.” 
The big man said, “I still say we would do better to ride the demon road. Might be it’s not as 
perilous as men say. And if it is, that only means more glory for those who dare it. Who would dare 
molest us? Drink with his sword, me with my hammer, that’s more than any demon could digest.” 

“And if Daenerys is dead before we reach her?” Quentyn said. “We must have a ship. Even if it is 
Adventure.” 
Gerris laughed. “You must be more desperate for Daenerys than I knew if you’d endure that 
stench for months on end. After three days, I’d be begging them to murder me. No, my prince, I pray 
you, not Adventure.” 
“Do you have a better way?” Quentyn asked him. “I do. It’s just now come to me. It has its risks, 
and it is not what you would call honorable, I grant you … but it will get you to your queen quicker than 
the demon road.” 
“Tell me,” said Quentyn Martell. 
JON 
Jon Snow read the letter over until the words began to blur and run together. I cannot sign this. I 
will not sign this. 
He almost burned the parchment then and there. Instead he took a sip of ale, the dregs of the 
half cup that remained from his solitary supper the night before. I have to sign it. They chose me to be 
their lord commander. The Wall is mine, and the Watch as well. The Night’s Watch takes no part. 
It was a relief when Dolorous Edd Tollett opened the door to tell him that Gilly was without. Jon 
set Maester Aemon’s letter aside. “I will see her.” He dreaded this. “Find Sam for me. I will want to 
speak with him next.” 
“He’ll be down with the books. My old septon used to say that books are dead men talking. 
Dead men should keep quiet, is what I say. No one wants to hear a dead man’s yabber.” Dolorous Edd 
went off muttering of worms and spiders. 
When Gilly entered, she went at once to her knees. Jon came around the table and drew her to 
her feet. “You don’t need to take a knee for me. That’s just for kings.” Though a wife and mother, Gilly 
still seemed half a child to him, a slender little thing wrapped up in one of Sam’s old cloaks. The cloak 
was so big on her that she could have hidden several other girls beneath its folds. “The babes are well?” 
he asked her. 
The wildling girl smiled timidly from under her cowl. “Yes, m’lord. I was scared I wouldn’t have 
milk enough for both, but the more they suck, the more I have. They’re strong.” 
“I have something hard to tell you.” He almost said ask, but caught himself at the last instant. 

“Is it Mance? Val begged the king to spare him. She said she’d let some kneeler marry her and 
never slit his throat if only Mance could live. That Lord o’Bones, he’s to be spared. Craster always swore 
he’d kill him if he ever showed his face about the keep. Mance never did half the things he done.” 
All Mance ever did was lead an army down upon the realm he once swore to protect. “Mance 
said our words, Gilly. Then he turned his cloak, wed Dalla, and crowned himself King-Beyond-the-Wall. 
His life is in the king’s hands now. It’s not him we need to talk about. It’s his son. Dalla’s boy.” 
“The babe?” Her voice trembled. “He never broke no oath, m’lord. He sleeps and cries and 
sucks, is all; he’s never done no harm to no one. Don’t let her burn him. Save him, please.” 
“Only you can do that, Gilly.” Jon told her how. 
Another woman would have shrieked at him, cursed him, damned him down to seven hells. 
Another woman might have flown at him in rage, slapped him, kicked him, raked at his eyes with her 
nails. Another woman might have thrown her defiance in his teeth. 
Gilly shook her head. “No. Please, no.” 
The raven picked up the word. “No,” it screamed. “Refuse, and the boy will burn. Not on the 
morrow, nor the day after … but soon, whenever Melisandre needs to wake a dragon or raise a wind or 
work some other spell requiring king’s blood. Mance will be ash and bone by then, so she will claim his 
son for the fire, and Stannis will not deny her. If you do not take the boy away, she will burn him.” 
“I’ll go,” said Gilly. “I’ll take him, I’ll take the both o’ them, Dalla’s boy and mine.” Tears rolled 
down her cheeks. If not for the way the candle made them glisten, Jon might never have known that she 
was weeping. Craster’s wives would have taught their daughters to shed their tears into a pillow. 
Perhaps they went outside to weep, well away from Craster’s fists. 
Jon closed the fingers of his sword hand. “Take both boys and the queen’s men will ride after 
you and drag you back. The boy will still burn … and you with him.” If I comfort her, she may think that 
tears can move me. She has to realize that I will not yield. “You’ll take one boy, and that one Dalla’s.” 
“A mother can’t leave her son, or else she’s cursed forever. Not a son. We saved him, Sam and 
me. Please. Please, m’lord. We saved him from the cold.” 
“Men say that freezing to death is almost peaceful. Fire, though … do you see the candle, Gilly?” 
She looked at the flame. “Yes.” 
“Touch it. Put your hand over the flame.” 
Her big brown eyes grew bigger still. She did not move. “Do it.” Kill the boy. “Now.” 
Trembling, the girl reached out her hand, held it well above the flickering candle flame. 
“Down. Let it kiss you.” 

Gilly lowered her hand. An inch. Another. When the flame licked her flesh, she snatched her 
hand back and began to sob. 
“Fire is a cruel way to die. Dalla died to give this child life, but you have nourished him, 
cherished him. You saved your own boy from the ice. Now save hers from the fire.” 
“They’ll burn my babe, then. The red woman. If she can’t have Dalla’s, she’ll burn mine.” 
“Your son has no king’s blood. Melisandre gains nothing by giving him to the fire. Stannis wants 
the free folk to fight for him, he will not burn an innocent without good cause. Your boy will be safe. I 
will find a wet nurse for him and he’ll be raised here at Castle Black under my protection. He’ll learn to 
hunt and ride, to fight with sword and axe and bow. I’ll even see that he is taught to read and write.” 
Sam would like that. “And when he is old enough, he will learn the truth of who he is. He’ll be free to 
seek you out if that is what he wants.” 
“You will make a crow of him.” She wiped at her tears with the back of a small pale hand. “I 
won’t. I won’t.” 
Kill the boy, thought Jon. “You will. Else I promise you, the day that they burn Dalla’s boy, yours 
will die as well.” 
“Die,” shrieked the Old Bear’s raven. “Die, die, die.” 
The girl sat hunched and shrunken, staring at the candle flame, tears glistening in her eyes. 
Finally Jon said, “You have my leave to go. Do not speak of this, but see that you are ready to depart an 
hour before first light. My men will come for you.” 
Gilly got to her feet. Pale and wordless, she departed, with never a look back at him. Jon heard 
her footsteps as she rushed through the armory. She was almost running. 
When he went to close the door, Jon saw that Ghost was stretched out beneath the anvil, 
gnawing on the bone of an ox. The big white direwolf looked up at his approach. “Past time that you 
were back.” He returned to his chair, to read over Maester Aemon’s letter once again. 
Samwell Tarly turned up a few moments later, clutching a stack of books. No sooner had he 
entered than Mormont’s raven flew at him demanding corn. Sam did his best to oblige, offering some 
kernels from the sack beside the door. The raven did its best to peck through his palm. Sam yowled, the 
bird flapped off, corn scattered. “Did that wretch break the skin?” Jon asked. 
Sam gingerly removed his glove. “He did. I’m bleeding.” 
“We all shed our blood for the Watch. Wear thicker gloves.” Jon shoved a chair toward him with 
a foot. “Sit, and have a look at this.” He handed Sam the parchment. 
“What is it?” 
“A paper shield.” 

Sam read it slowly. “A letter to King Tommen?” 
“At Winterfell, Tommen fought my brother Bran with wooden swords,” Jon said, remembering. 
“He wore so much padding he looked like a stuffed goose. Bran knocked him to the ground.” He went to 
the window and threw the shutters open. The air outside was cold and bracing, though the sky was a 
dull grey. “Yet Bran’s dead, and pudgy pink-faced Tommen is sitting on the Iron Throne, with a crown 
nestled amongst his golden curls.” 
That got an odd look from Sam, and for a moment he looked as if he wanted to say something. 
Instead he swallowed and turned back to the parchment. “You haven’t signed the letter.” 
Jon shook his head. “The Old Bear begged the Iron Throne for help a hundred times. They sent 
him Janos Slynt. No letter will make the Lannisters love us better. Not once they hear that we’ve been 
helping Stannis.” 
“Only to defend the Wall, not in his rebellion. That’s what it says here.” 
“The distinction may escape Lord Tywin.” Jon snatched the letter back. “Why would he help us 
now? He never did before.” 
“Well, he will not want it said that Stannis rode to the defense of the realm whilst King Tommen 
was playing with his toys. That would bring scorn down upon House Lannister.” 
“It’s death and destruction I want to bring down upon House Lannister, not scorn.” Jon read 
from the letter. “The Night’s Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms. Our oaths are 
sworn to the realm, and the realm now stands in dire peril. Stannis Baratheon aids us against our foes 
from beyond the Wall, though we are not his men …” 
Sam squirmed in his seat. “Well, we’re not. Are we?” 
“I gave Stannis food, shelter, and the Nightfort, plus leave to settle some free folk in the Gift. 
That’s all.” 
“Lord Tywin will say it was too much.” 
“Stannis says it’s not enough. The more you give a king, the more he wants. We are walking on a 
bridge of ice with an abyss on either side. Pleasing one king is difficult enough. Pleasing two is hardly 
possible.” 
“Yes, but … if the Lannisters should prevail and Lord Tywin decides that we betrayed the king by 
aiding Stannis, it could mean the end of the Night’s Watch. He has the Tyrells behind him, with all the 
strength of Highgarden. And he did defeat Lord Stannis on the Blackwater.” 
“The Blackwater was one battle. Robb won all his battles and still lost his head. If Stannis can 
raise the north …” 

Sam hesitated, then said, “The Lannisters have northmen of their own. Lord Bolton and his 
bastard.” 
“Stannis has the Karstarks. If he can win White Harbor …” 
“If,” Sam stressed. “If not … my lord, even a paper shield is better than none.” 
“I suppose so.” Him and Aemon both. Somehow he had hoped that Sam Tarly might see it 
differently. It is only ink and parchment. Resigned, he grabbed the quill and signed. “Get the sealing 
wax.” Before I change my mind. Sam hastened to obey. Jon fixed the lord commander’s seal and handed 
him the letter. “Take this to Maester Aemon when you leave, and tell him to dispatch a bird to King’s 
Landing.” 
“I will.” Sam sounded relieved. “My lord, if I might ask … I saw Gilly leaving. She was almost 
crying.” 
“Val sent her to plead for Mance again,” Jon lied, and they talked for a while of Mance and 
Stannis and Melisandre of Asshai, until the raven ate the last corn kernel and screamed, “Blood.” 
“I am sending Gilly away,” Jon said. “Her and the boy. We will need to find another wet nurse 
for his milk brother.” 
“Goat’s milk might serve, until you do. It’s better for a babe than cow’s milk.” Talking about 
breasts plainly made Sam uncomfortable, and suddenly he began to speak of history, and boy 
commanders who had lived and died hundreds of years ago. Jon cut him off with, “Tell me something 
useful. Tell me of our enemy.” 
“The Others.” Sam licked his lips. “They are mentioned in the annals, though not as often as I 
would have thought. The annals I’ve found and looked at, that is. There’s more I haven’t found, I know. 
Some of the older books are falling to pieces. The pages crumble when I try and turn them. And the 
really old books … either they have crumbled all away or they are buried somewhere that I haven’t 
looked yet or … well, it could be that there are no such books and never were. The oldest histories we 
have were written after the Andals came to Westeros. The First Men only left us runes on rocks, so 
everything we think we know about the Age of Heroes and the Dawn Age and the Long Night comes 
from accounts set down by septons thousands of years later. There are archmaesters at the Citadel who 
question all of it. Those old histories are full of kings who reigned for hundreds of years, and knights 
riding around a thousand years before there were knights. You know the tales, Brandon the Builder, 
Symeon Star-Eyes, Night’s King … we say that you’re the nine-hundred-and-ninety-eighth Lord 
Commander of the Night’s Watch, but the oldest list I’ve found shows six hundred seventy-four 
commanders, which suggests that it was written during—” 
“Long ago,” Jon broke in. “What about the Others?” 
“I found mention of dragonglass. The children of the forest used to give the Night’s Watch a 
hundred obsidian daggers every year, during the Age of Heroes. The Others come when it is cold, most 

of the tales agree. Or else it gets cold when they come. Sometimes they appear during snowstorms and 
melt away when the skies clear. They hide from the light of the sun and emerge by night … or else night 
falls when they emerge. Some stories speak of them riding the corpses of dead animals. Bears, 
direwolves, mammoths, horses, it makes no matter, so long as the beast is dead. The one that killed 
Small Paul was riding a dead horse, so that part’s plainly true. Some accounts speak of giant ice spiders 
too. I don’t know what those are. Men who fall in battle against the Others must be burned, or else the 
dead will rise again as their thralls.” 
“We knew all this. The question is, how do we fight them?” 
“The armor of the Others is proof against most ordinary blades, if the tales can be believed, and 
their own swords are so cold they shatter steel. Fire will dismay them, though, and they are vulnerable 
to obsidian. I found one account of the Long Night that spoke of the last hero slaying Others with a blade 
of dragonsteel. Supposedly they could not stand against it.” 
“Dragonsteel?” The term was new to Jon. “Valyrian steel?” 
“That was my first thought as well.” 
“So if I can just convince the lords of the Seven Kingdoms to give us their Valyrian blades, all is 
saved? That won’t be hard.” No harder than asking them to give up their coin and castles. He gave a 
bitter laugh. “Did you find who the Others are, where they come from, what they want?” 
“Not yet, my lord, but it may be that I’ve just been reading the wrong books. There are hundreds 
I have not looked at yet. Give me more time and I will find whatever there is to be found.” 
“There is no more time. You need to get your things together, Sam. You’re going with Gilly.” 
“Going?” Sam gaped at him openmouthed, as if he did not understand the meaning of the word. 
“I’m going? To Eastwatch, my lord? Or … where am I …” 
“Oldtown.” 
“Oldtown?” Sam repeated, in a high-pitched squeak. “Aemon as well.” 
“Aemon? Maester Aemon? But … he’s one hundred and two years old, my lord, he can’t … 
you’re sending him and me? Who will tend the ravens? If there’s sick or wounded, who …” 
“Clydas. He’s been with Aemon for years.” 
“Clydas is only a steward, and his eyes are going bad. You need a maester. Maester Aemon is so 
frail, a sea voyage … it might … he’s old, and …” 
“His life will be at risk. I am aware of that, Sam, but the risk is greater here. Stannis knows who 
Aemon is. If the red woman requires king’s blood for her spells …” 

“Oh.” Sam’s fat cheeks seemed to drain of color. “Dareon will join you at Eastwatch. My hope is 
that his songs will win some men for us in the south. The Blackbird will deliver you to Braavos. From 
there, you’ll arrange your own passage to Oldtown. If you still mean to claim Gilly’s babe as your 
bastard, send her and the child on to Horn Hill. Elsewise, Aemon will find a servant’s place for her at the 
Citadel.” 
“My b-b-bastard. Yes, I … my mother and my sisters will help Gilly with the child. Dareon could 
see her to Oldtown just as well as me. I’m … I’ve been working at my archery every afternoon with 
Ulmer, as you commanded … well, except when I’m in the vaults, but you told me to find out about the 
Others. The longbow makes my shoulders ache and raises blisters on my fingers.” He showed Jon his 
hand. “I still do it, though. I can hit the target more often than not now, but I’m still the worst archer 
who ever bent a bow. I like Ulmer’s stories, though. Someone needs to write them down and put them 
in a book.” 
“You do it. They have parchment and ink at the Citadel, as well as longbows. I will expect you to 
continue with your practice. Sam, the Night’s Watch has hundreds of men who can loose an arrow, but 
only a handful who can read or write. I need you to become my new maester.” 
“My lord, I … my work is here, the books …” 
“… will be here when you return to us.” 
Sam put a hand to his throat. “My lord, the Citadel … they make you cut up corpses there. I 
cannot wear a chain.” 
“You can. You will. Maester Aemon is old and blind. His strength is leaving him. Who will take his 
place when he dies? Maester Mullin at the Shadow Tower is more fighter than scholar, and Maester 
Harmune of Eastwatch is drunk more than he’s sober.” 
“If you ask the Citadel for more maesters …” 
“I mean to. We’ll have need of every one. Aemon Targaryen is not so easily replaced, however.” 
This is not going as I had hoped. He had known Gilly would be hard, but he had assumed Sam would be 
glad to trade the dangers of the Wall for the warmth of Oldtown. “I was certain this would please you,” 
he said, puzzled. “There are so many books at the Citadel that no man can hope to read them all. You 
would do well there, Sam. I know you would.” 
“No. I could read the books, but … a m-maester must be a healer and b-b-blood makes me 
faint.” His hand shook, to prove the truth of that. “I’m Sam the Scared, not Sam the Slayer.” 
“Scared? Of what? The chidings of old men? Sam, you saw the wights come swarming up the 
Fist, a tide of living dead men with black hands and bright blue eyes. You slew an Other.” 
“It was the d-d-d-dragonglass, not me.” 

“Be quiet,” Jon snapped. After Gilly, he had no patience for the fat boy’s fears. “You lied and 
schemed and plotted to make me lord commander. You will obey me. You’ll go to the Citadel and forge 
a chain, and if you have to cut up corpses, so be it. At least in Oldtown the corpses won’t object.” 
“My lord, my f-f-f-father, Lord Randyll, he, he, he, he, he … the life of a maester is a life of 
servitude. No son of House Tarly will ever wear a chain. The men of Horn Hill do not bow and scrape to 
petty lords. Jon, I cannot disobey my father.” 
Kill the boy, Jon thought. The boy in you, and the one in him. Kill the both of them, you bloody 
bastard. “You have no father. Only brothers. Only us. Your life belongs to the Night’s Watch, so go and 
stuff your small-clothes into a sack, along with anything else you care to take to Oldtown. You leave an 
hour before sunrise. And here’s another order. From this day forth, you will not call yourself a craven. 
You’ve faced more things this past year than most men face in a lifetime. You can face the Citadel, but 
you’ll face it as a Sworn Brother of the Night’s Watch. I can’t command you to be brave, but I can 
command you to hide your fears. You said the words, Sam. Remember?” 
“I … I’ll try.” 
“You won’t try. You will obey.” 
“Obey.” Mormont’s raven flapped its great black wings. 
Sam seemed to sag. “As my lord commands. Does … does Maester Aemon know?” 
“It was as much his idea as mine.” Jon opened the door for him. “No farewells. The fewer folk 
who know of this, the better. An hour before first light, by the lichyard.” 
Sam fled from him just as Gilly had. 
Jon was tired. I need sleep. He had been up half the night poring over maps, writing letters, and 
making plans with Maester Aemon. Even after stumbling into his narrow bed, rest had not come easily. 
He knew what he would face today, and found himself tossing restlessly as he brooded on Maester 
Aemon’s final words. “Allow me to give my lord one last piece of counsel,” the old man had said, “the 
same counsel that I once gave my brother when we parted for the last time. He was three-and-thirty 
when the Great Council chose him to mount the Iron Throne. A man grown with sons of his own, yet in 
some ways still a boy. Egg had an innocence to him, a sweetness we all loved. Kill the boy within you, I 
told him the day I took ship for the Wall. It takes a man to rule. An Aegon, not an Egg. Kill the boy and let 
the man be born.” The old man felt Jon’s face. “You are half the age that Egg was, and your own burden 
is a crueler one, I fear. You will have little joy of your command, but I think you have the strength in you 
to do the things that must be done. Kill the boy, Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy and let 
the man be born.” 
Jon donned his cloak and strode outside. He made the rounds of Castle Black each day, visiting 
the men on watch and hearing their reports first hand, watching Ulmer and his charges at the archery 

butts, talking with king’s men and queen’s men alike, walking the ice atop the Wall to have a look at the 
forest. Ghost padded after him, a white shadow at his side. 
Kedge Whiteye had the Wall when Jon made his ascent. Kedge had seen forty-odd namedays, 
thirty of them on the Wall. His left eye was blind, his right eye mean. In the wild, alone with axe and 
garron, he was as good a ranger as any in the Watch, but he had never gotten on well with the other 
men. “A quiet day,” he told Jon. “Nothing to report, except the wrong-way rangers.” 
“The wrong-way rangers?” Jon asked. 
Kedge grinned. “A pair of knights. Went riding off an hour ago, south along the kingsroad. When 
Dywen saw them buggering off, he said the southron fools were riding the wrong way.” 
“I see,” said Jon. 
He found out more from Dywen himself, as the old forester sucked down a bowl of barley broth 
in the barracks. “Aye, m’lord, I saw them. Horpe and Massey, it were. Claimed Stannis sent ’em out, but 
never said where or what for or when they would be back.” 
Ser Richard Horpe and Ser Justin Massey were both queen’s men, and high in the king’s councils. 
A pair of common freeriders would have served if all that Stannis had in mind was scouting, Jon Snow 
reflected, but knights are better suited to act as messengers or envoys. Cotter Pyke had sent word from 
Eastwatch that the Onion Lord and Salladhor Saan had set sail for White Harbor to treat with Lord 
Manderly. It made sense that Stannis would send out other envoys. His Grace was not a patient man. 
Whether the wrong-way rangers would return was another question. Knights they might be, but 
they did not know the north. There will be eyes along the kingsroad, not all of them friendly. It was none 
of Jon’s concern, though. Let Stannis have his secrets. The gods know that I have mine. 
Ghost slept at the foot of the bed that night, and for once Jon did not dream he was a wolf. Even 
so, he slept fitfully, tossing for hours before sliding down into a nightmare. Gilly was in it, weeping, 
pleading with him to leave her babes alone, but he ripped the children from her arms and hacked their 
heads off, then swapped the heads around and told her to sew them back in place. 
When he woke, he found Edd Tollett looming over him in the darkness of his bedchamber. 
“M’lord? It is time. The hour of the wolf. You left orders to be woken.” 
“Bring me something hot.” Jon threw off his blankets. 
Edd was back by the time that he had dressed, pressing a steaming cup into his hands. Jon 
expected hot mulled wine, and was surprised to find that it was soup, a thin broth that smelled of leeks 
and carrots but seemed to have no leeks or carrots in it. The smells are stronger in my wolf dreams, he 
reflected, and food tastes richer too. Ghost is more alive than I am. He left the empty cup upon the 
forge. 

Kegs was on his door this morning. “I will want to speak with Bedwyck and with Janos Slynt,” Jon 
told him. “Have them both here at first light.” 
Outside the world was black and still. Cold, but not dangerously cold. Not yet. It will be warmer 
when the sun comes up. If the gods are good, the Wall may weep. When they reached the lichyard, the 
column had already formed up. Jon had given Black Jack Bulwer command of the escort, with a dozen 
mounted rangers under him, and two wayns. One was piled high with chests and crates and sacks, 
provisions for the journey. The other had a stiff roof of boiled leather to keep the wind off. Maester 
Aemon was seated in the back of it, huddled in a bearskin that made him look as small as a child. Sam 
and Gilly stood nearby. Her eyes were red and puffy, but the boy was in her arms, bundled tight. 
Whether it was her boy or Dalla’s he could not be sure. He had only seen the two together a few times. 
Gilly’s boy was older, Dalla’s more robust, but they were close enough in age and size so that no one 
who did not know them well would be able to easily tell one from the other. 
“Lord Snow,” Maester Aemon called out, “I left a book for you in my chambers. The Jade 
Compendium. It was written by the Volantene adventurer Colloquo Votar, who traveled to the east and 
visited all the lands of the Jade Sea. There is a passage you may find of interest. I’ve told Clydas to mark 
it for you.” 
“I’ll be sure to read it.” 
Maester Aemon wiped his nose. “Knowledge is a weapon, Jon. Arm yourself well before you ride 
forth to battle.” 
“I will.” Jon felt something wet and cold upon his face. When he raised his eyes, he saw that it 
was snowing. A bad omen. He turned to Black Jack Bulwer. “Make as good a time as you can, but take no 
foolish risks. You have an old man and a suckling babe with you. See that you keep them warm and well 
fed.” 
“You do the same, m’lord.” Gilly did not seem in any haste to climb into the wayn. “You do the 
same for t’other. Find another wet nurse, like you said. You promised me you would. The boy … Dalla’s 
boy … the little prince, I mean … you find him some good woman, so he grows up big and strong.” 
“You have my word.” 
“Don’t you name him. Don’t you do that, till he’s past two years. It’s ill luck to name them when 
they’re still on the breast. You crows may not know that, but it’s true.” 
“As you command, my lady.” 
“Don’t you call me that. I’m a mother, not a lady. I’m Craster’s wife and Craster’s daughter, and 
a mother.” She gave the babe to Dolorous Edd as she climbed into the wayn and covered herself with 
furs. When Edd gave her back the child, Gilly put him to her breast. Sam turned away from the sight, 
red-faced, and heaved himself up onto his mare. “Let’s do this,” commanded Black Jack Bulwer, 
snapping his whip. The wayns rolled forward. 

Sam lingered a moment. “Well,” he said, “farewell.” 
“And to you, Sam,” said Dolorous Edd. “Your boat’s not like to sink, I don’t think. Boats only sink 
when I’m aboard.” 
Jon was remembering. “The first time I saw Gilly she was pressed back against the wall of 
Craster’s Keep, this skinny darkhaired girl with her big belly, cringing away from Ghost. He had gotten in 
among her rabbits, and I think she was frightened that he would tear her open and devour the babe … 
but it was not the wolf she should have been afraid of, was it?” 
“She has more courage than she knows,” said Sam. “So do you, Sam. Have a swift, safe voyage, 
and take care of her and Aemon and the child.” The cold trickles on his face reminded Jon of the day 
he’d bid farewell to Robb at Winterfell, never knowing that it was for the last time. “And pull your hood 
up. The snowflakes are melting in your hair.” 
By the time the little column had dwindled in the distance, the eastern sky had gone from black 
to grey and the snow was falling heavily. “Giant will be waiting on the lord commander’s pleasure,” 
Dolorous Edd reminded him. “Janos Slynt as well.” 
“Yes.” Jon Snow glanced up at the Wall, towering over them like a cliff of ice. A hundred leagues 
from end to end, and seven hundred feet high. The strength of the Wall w
