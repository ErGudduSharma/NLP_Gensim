A FEAST FOR CROWS
Book Four: A Song of Ice and Fire 
George R.R. Martin 
PROLOGUE 
“Dragons,” said Mollander. He snatched a withered apple off the ground and tossed it 
hand to hand. 
“Throw the apple,” urged Alleras the Sphinx. He slipped an arrow from his quiver and nocked 
it to his bowstring. 
“I should like to see a dragon.” Roone was the youngest of them, a chunky boy still two years 
shy of manhood. “I should like that very much.” 
And I should like to sleep with Rosey’s arms around me, Pate thought. He shifted restlessly on 
the bench. By the morrow the girl could well be his. I will take her far from Oldtown, across the 
narrow sea to one of the Free Cities. There were no maesters there, no one to accuse him. 
He could hear Emma’s laughter coming through a shuttered window overhead, mingled with 
the deeper voice of the man she was entertaining. She was the oldest of the serving wenches at 
the Quill and Tankard, forty if she was a day, but still pretty in a fleshy sort of way. Rosey was 
her daughter, fifteen and freshly flowered. Emma had decreed that Rosey’s maidenhead would 
cost a golden dragon. Pate had saved nine silver stags and a pot of copper stars and pennies, for 
all the good that would do him. He would have stood a better chance of hatching a real dragon 
than saving up enough coin to make a golden one. 
“You were born too late for dragons, lad,” Armen the Acolyte told Roone. Armen wore a 
leather thong about his neck, strung with links of pewter, tin, lead, and copper, and like most 
acolytes he seemed to believe that novices had turnips growing from their shoulders in place of 
heads. “The last one perished during the reign of King Aegon the Third.” 
“The last dragon in Westeros,” insisted Mollander. 
“Throw the apple,” Alleras urged again. He was a comely youth, their Sphinx. All the serving 
wenches doted on him. Even Rosey would sometimes touch him on the arm when she brought 
him wine, and Pate had to gnash his teeth and pretend not to see. 
“The last dragon in Westeros was the last dragon,” said Armen doggedly. “That is well known.” 

“The apple,” Alleras said. “Unless you mean to eat it.” 
“Here.” Dragging his clubfoot, Mollander took a short hop, whirled, and whipped the apple 
sidearm into the mists that hung above the Honeywine. If not for his foot, he would have been a 
knight like his father. He had the strength for it in those thick arms and broad shoulders. Far and 
fast the apple flew... 
...but not as fast as the arrow that whistled after it, a yard-long shaft of golden wood fletched 
with scarlet feathers. Pate did not see the arrow catch the apple, but he heard it. A soft chunk 
echoed back across the river, followed by a splash. 
Mollander whistled. “You cored it. Sweet.” 
Not half as sweet as Rosey. Pate loved her hazel eyes and budding breasts, and the way she 
smiled every time she saw him. He loved the dimples in her cheeks. Sometimes she went 
barefoot as she served, to feel the grass beneath her feet. He loved that too. He loved the clean 
fresh smell of her, the way her hair curled behind her ears. He even loved her toes. One night 
she’d let him rub her feet and play with them, and he’d made up a funny tale for every toe to 
keep her giggling. 
Perhaps he would do better to remain on this side of the narrow sea. He could buy a donkey 
with the coin he’d saved, and he and Rosey could take turns riding it as they wandered Westeros. 
Ebrose might not think him worthy of the silver, but Pate knew how to set a bone and leech a 
fever. The smallfolk would be grateful for his help. If he could learn to cut hair and shave beards, 
he might even be a barber. That would be enough, he told himself, so long as I had Rosey. Rosey 
was all that he wanted in the world. 
That had not always been so. Once he had dreamed of being a maester in a castle, in service to 
some open-handed lord who would honor him for his wisdom and bestow a fine white horse on 
him to thank him for his service. How high he’d ride, how nobly, smiling down at the smallfolk 
when he passed them on the road... 
One night in the Quill and Tankard’s common room, after his second tankard of fearsomely 
strong cider, Pate had boasted that he would not always be a novice. “Too true,” Lazy Leo had 
called out. “You’ll be a former novice, herding swine.” 
He drained the dregs of his tankard. The torchlit terrace of the Quill and Tankard was an island 
of light in a sea of mist this morning. Downriver, the distant beacon of the Hightower floated in 
the damp of night like a hazy orange moon, but the light did little to lift his spirits. 
The alchemist should have come by now. Had it all been some cruel jape, or had something 
happened to the man? It would not have been the first time that good fortune had turned sour on 
Pate. He had once counted himself lucky to be chosen to help old Archmaester Walgrave with 
the ravens, never dreaming that before long he would also be fetching the man’s meals, sweeping 
out his chambers, and dressing him every morning. Everyone said that Walgrave had forgotten 
more of ravencraft than most maesters ever knew, so Pate assumed a black iron link was the least 
that he could hope for, only to find that Walgrave could not grant him one. The old man 
remained an archmaester only by courtesy. As great a maester as once he’d been, now his robes 
concealed soiled smallclothes oft as not, and half a year ago some acolytes found him weeping in 

the Library, unable to find his way back to his chambers. Maester Gormon sat below the iron 
mask in Walgrave’s place, the same Gormon who had once accused Pate of theft. 
In the apple tree beside the water, a nightingale began to sing. It was a sweet sound, a welcome 
respite from the harsh screams and endless quorking of the ravens he had tended all day long. 
The white ravens knew his name, and would mutter it to each other whenever they caught sight 
of him, “Pate, Pate, Pate,” until he wanted to scream. The big white birds were Archmaester 
Walgrave’s pride. He wanted them to eat him when he died, but Pate half suspected that they 
meant to eat him too. 
Perhaps it was the fearsomely strong cider—he had not come here to drink, but Alleras had 
been buying to celebrate his copper link, and guilt had made him thirsty—but it almost sounded 
as if the nightingale were trilling gold for iron, gold for iron, gold for iron. Which was passing 
strange, because that was what the stranger had said the night Rosey brought the two of them 
together. “Who are you?” Pate had demanded of him, and the man had replied, “An alchemist. I 
can change iron into gold.” And then the coin was in his hand, dancing across his knuckles, the 
soft yellow gold shining in the candlelight. On one side was a three-headed dragon, on the other 
the head of some dead king. Gold for iron, Pate remembered, you won’t do better. Do you want 
her? Do you love her? “I am no thief,” he had told the man who called himself the alchemist, “I 
am a novice of the Citadel.” The alchemist had bowed his head, and said, “If you should 
reconsider, I shall return here three days hence, with my dragon.” 
Three days had passed. Pate had returned to the Quill and Tankard, still uncertain what he was, 
but instead of the alchemist he’d found Mollander and Armen and the Sphinx, with Roone in 
tow. It would have raised suspicions not to join them. 
The Quill and Tankard never closed. For six hundred years it had been standing on its island in 
the Honeywine, and never once had its doors been shut to trade. Though the tall, timbered 
building leaned toward the south the way novices sometimes leaned after a tankard, Pate 
expected that the inn would go on standing for another six hundred years, selling wine and ale 
and fearsomely strong cider to rivermen and seamen, smiths and singers, priests and princes, and 
the novices and acolytes of the Citadel. 
“Oldtown is not the world,” declared Mollander, too loudly. He was a knight’s son, and drunk 
as drunk could be. Since they brought him word of his father’s death upon the Blackwater, he got 
drunk most every night. Even in Oldtown, far from the fighting and safe behind its walls, the 
War of the Five Kings had touched them all... although Archmaester Benedict insisted that there 
had never been a war of five kings, since Renly Baratheon had been slain before Balon Greyjoy 
had crowned himself. 
“My father always said the world was bigger than any lord’s castle,” Mollander went on. 
“Dragons must be the least of the things a man might find in Qarth and Asshai and Yi Ti. These 
sailors’ stories...” 
“... are stories told by sailors,” Armen interrupted. “Sailors, my dear Mollander. Go back down 
to the docks, and I wager you’ll find sailors who’ll tell you of the mermaids that they bedded, or 
how they spent a year in the belly of a fish.” 

“How do you know they didn’t?” Mollander thumped through the grass, looking for more 
apples. “You’d need to be down the belly yourself to swear they weren’t. One sailor with a story, 
aye, a man might laugh at that, but when oarsmen off four different ships tell the same tale in 
four different tongues...” 
“The tales are not the same,” insisted Armen. “Dragons in Asshai, dragons in Qarth, dragons in 
Meereen, Dothraki dragons, dragons freeing slaves... each telling differs from the last.” 
“Only in details.” Mollander grew more stubborn when he drank, and even when sober he was 
bullheaded. “All speak of dragons, and a beautiful young queen.” 
The only dragon Pate cared about was made of yellow gold. He wondered what had happened 
to the alchemist. The third day. He said he’d be here. 
“There’s another apple near your foot,” Alleras called to Mollander, “and I still have two 
arrows in my quiver.” 
“Fuck your quiver.” Mollander scooped up the windfall. “This one’s wormy,” he complained, 
but he threw it anyway. The arrow caught the apple as it began to fall and sliced it clean in two. 
One half landed on a turret roof, tumbled to a lower roof, bounced, and missed Armen by a foot. 
“If you cut a worm in two, you make two worms,” the acolyte informed them. 
“If only it worked that way with apples, no one would ever need go hungry,” said Alleras with 
one of his soft smiles. The Sphinx was always smiling, as if he knew some secret jape. It gave 
him a wicked look that went well with his pointed chin, widow’s peak, and dense mat of close-
cropped jet-black curls. 
Alleras would make a maester. He had only been at the Citadel for a year, yet already he had 
forged three links of his maester’s chain. Armen might have more, but each of his had taken him 
a year to earn. Still, he would make a maester too. Roone and Mollander remained pink-necked 
novices, but Roone was very young and Mollander preferred drinking to reading. 
Pate, though... 
He had been five years at the Citadel, arriving when he was no more than three-and-ten, yet his 
neck remained as pink as it had been on the day he first arrived from the westerlands. Twice had 
he believed himself ready. The first time he had gone before Archmaester Vaellyn to 
demonstrate his knowledge of the heavens. Instead he learned how Vinegar Vaellyn had earned 
that name. It took Pate two years to summon up the courage to try again. This time he submitted 
himself to kindly old Archmaester Ebrose, renowned for his soft voice and gentle hands, but 
Ebrose’s sighs had somehow proved just as painful as Vaellyn’s barbs. 
“One last apple,” promised Alleras, “and I will tell you what I suspect about these dragons.” 
“What could you know that I don’t?” grumbled Mollander. He spied an apple on a branch, 
jumped up, pulled it down, and threw. Alleras drew his bowstring back to his ear, turning 
gracefully to follow the target in flight. He loosed his shaft just as the apple began to fall. 
“You always miss your last shot,” said Roone. 
The apple splashed down into the river, untouched. 
“See?” said Roone. 

“The day you make them all is the day you stop improving.” Alleras unstrung his longbow and 
eased it into its leather case. The bow was carved from goldenheart, a rare and fabled wood from 
the Summer Isles. Pate had tried to bend it once, and failed. The Sphinx looks slight, but there’s 
strength in those slim arms, he reflected, as Alleras threw a leg across the bench and reached for 
his wine cup. “The dragon has three heads,” he announced in his soft Dornish drawl. 
“Is this a riddle?” Roone wanted to know. “Sphinxes always speak in riddles in the tales.” 
“No riddle.” Alleras sipped his wine. The rest of them were quaffing tankards of the fearsomely 
strong cider that the Quill and Tankard was renowned for, but he preferred the strange, sweet 
wines of his mother’s country. Even in Oldtown such wines did not come cheap. 
It had been Lazy Leo who dubbed Alleras “the Sphinx.” A sphinx is a bit of this, a bit of that: a 
human face, the body of a lion, the wings of a hawk. Alleras was the same: his father was a 
Dornishman, his mother a black-skinned Summer Islander. His own skin was dark as teak. And 
like the green marble sphinxes that flanked the Citadel’s main gate, Alleras had eyes of onyx. 
“No dragon has ever had three heads except on shields and banners,” Armen the Acolyte said 
firmly. “That was a heraldic charge, no more. Furthermore, the Targaryens are all dead.” 
“Not all,” said Alleras. “The Beggar King had a sister.” 
“I thought her head was smashed against a wall,” said Roone. 
“No,” said Alleras. “It was Prince Rhaegar’s young son Aegon whose head was dashed against 
the wall by the Lion of Lannister’s brave men. We speak of Rhaegar’s sister, born on 
Dragonstone before its fall. The one they called Daenerys.” 
“The Stormborn. I recall her now.” Mollander lifted his tankard high, sloshing the cider that 
remained. “Here’s to her!” He gulped, slammed his empty tankard down, belched, and wiped his 
mouth with the back of his hand. “Where’s Rosey? Our rightful queen deserves another round of 
cider, wouldn’t you say?” 
Armen the Acolyte looked alarmed. “Lower your voice, fool. You should not even jape about 
such things. You never know who could be listening. The Spider has ears everywhere.” 
“Ah, don’t piss your breeches, Armen. I was proposing a drink, not a rebellion.” 
Pate heard a chuckle. A soft, sly voice called out from behind him. “I always knew you were a 
traitor, Hopfrog.” Lazy Leo was slouching by the foot of the old plank bridge, draped in satin 
striped in green and gold, with a black silk half cape pinned to his shoulder by a rose of jade. The 
wine he’d dribbled down his front had been a robust red, judging from the color of the spots. A 
lock of his ash-blond hair fell down across one eye. 
Mollander bristled at the sight of him. “Bugger that. Go away. You are not welcome here.” 
Alleras laid a hand upon his arm to calm him, whilst Armen frowned. “Leo. My lord. I had 
understood that you were still confined to the Citadel for...” 
“... three more days.” Lazy Leo shrugged. “Perestan says the world is forty thousand years old. 
Mollos says five hundred thousand. What are three days, I ask you?” Though there were a dozen 
empty tables on the terrace, Leo sat himself at theirs. “Buy me a cup of Arbor gold, Hopfrog, and 
perhaps I won’t inform my father of your toast. The tiles turned against me at the Checkered 

Hazard, and I wasted my last stag on supper. Suckling pig in plum sauce, stuffed with chestnuts 
and white truffles. A man must eat. What did you lads have?” 
“Mutton,” muttered Mollander. He sounded none too pleased about it. “We shared a haunch of 
boiled mutton.” 
“I’m certain it was filling.” Leo turned to Alleras. “A lord’s son should be open-handed, 
Sphinx. I understand you won your copper link. I’ll drink to that.” 
Alleras smiled back at him. “I only buy for friends. And I am no lord’s son, I’ve told you that. 
My mother was a trader.” 
Leo’s eyes were hazel, bright with wine and malice. “Your mother was a monkey from the 
Summer Isles. The Dornish will fuck anything with a hole between its legs. Meaning no offense. 
You may be brown as a nut, but at least you bathe. Unlike our spotted pig boy.” He waved a 
hand toward Pate. 
If I hit him in the mouth with my tankard, I could knock out half his teeth, Pate thought. Spotted 
Pate the pig boy was the hero of a thousand ribald stories: a good-hearted, empty-headed lout 
who always managed to best the fat lordlings, haughty knights, and pompous septons who beset 
him. Somehow his stupidity would turn out to have been a sort of uncouth cunning; the tales 
always ended with Spotted Pate sitting on a lord’s high seat or bedding some knight’s daughter. 
But those were stories. In the real world pig boys never fared so well. Pate sometimes thought 
his mother must have hated him to have named him as she did. 
Alleras was no longer smiling. “You will apologize.” 
“Will I?” said Leo. “How can I, with my throat so dry...” 
“You shame your House with every word you say,” Alleras told him. “You shame the Citadel 
by being one of us.” 
“I know. So buy me some wine, that I might drown my shame.” 
Mollander said, “I would tear your tongue out by the roots.” 
“Truly? Then how would I tell you about the dragons?” Leo shrugged again. “The mongrel has 
the right of it. The Mad King’s daughter is alive, and she’s hatched herself three dragons.” 
“Three?” said Roone, astonished. 
Leo patted his hand. “More than two and less than four. I would not try for my golden link just 
yet if I were you.” 
“You leave him be,” warned Mollander. 
“Such a chivalrous Hopfrog. As you wish. Every man off every ship that’s sailed within a 
hundred leagues of Qarth is speaking of these dragons. A few will even tell you that they’ve seen 
them. The Mage is inclined to believe them.” 
Armen pursed his lips in disapproval. “Marwyn is unsound. Archmaester Perestan would be the 
first to tell you that.” 
“Archmaester Ryam says so too,” said Roone. 
Leo yawned. “The sea is wet, the sun is warm, and the menagerie hates the mastiff.” 
He has a mocking name for everyone, thought Pate, but he could not deny that Marwyn looked 
more a mastiff than a maester. As if he wants to bite you. The Mage was not like other maesters. 

People said that he kept company with whores and hedge wizards, talked with hairy Ibbenese 
and pitch-black Summer Islanders in their own tongues, and sacrificed to queer gods at the little 
sailors’ temples down by the wharves. Men spoke of seeing him down in the undercity, in rat pits 
and black brothels, consorting with mummers, singers, sellswords, even beggars. Some even 
whispered that once he had killed a man with his fists. 
When Marwyn had returned to Oldtown, after spending eight years in the east mapping distant 
lands, searching for lost books, and studying with warlocks and shadowbinders, Vinegar Vaellyn 
had dubbed him “Marwyn the Mage.” The name was soon all over Oldtown, to Vaellyn’s vast 
annoyance. “Leave spells and prayers to priests and septons and bend your wits to learning truths 
a man can trust in,” Archmaester Ryam had once counseled Pate, but Ryam’s ring and rod and 
mask were yellow gold, and his maester’s chain had no link of Valyrian steel. 
Armen looked down his nose at Lazy Leo. He had the perfect nose for it, long and thin and 
pointed. “Archmaester Marwyn believes in many curious things,” he said, “but he has no more 
proof of dragons than Mollander. Just more sailors’ stories.” 
“You’re wrong,” said Leo. “There is a glass candle burning in the Mage’s chambers.” 
A hush fell over the torchlit terrace. Armen sighed and shook his head. Mollander began to 
laugh. The Sphinx studied Leo with his big black eyes. Roone looked lost. 
Pate knew about the glass candles, though he had never seen one burn. They were the worst-
kept secret of the Citadel. It was said that they had been brought to Oldtown from Valyria a 
thousand years before the Doom. He had heard there were four; one was green and three were 
black, and all were tall and twisted. 
“What are these glass candles?” asked Roone. 
Armen the Acolyte cleared his throat. “The night before an acolyte says his vows, he must stand 
a vigil in the vault. No lantern is permitted him, no torch, no lamp, no taper... only a candle of 
obsidian. He must spend the night in darkness, unless he can light that candle. Some will try. The 
foolish and the stubborn, those who have made a study of these so-called higher mysteries. Often 
they cut their fingers, for the ridges on the candles are said to be as sharp as razors. Then, with 
bloody hands, they must wait upon the dawn, brooding on their failure. Wiser men simply go to 
sleep, or spend their night in prayer, but every year there are always a few who must try.” 
“Yes.” Pate had heard the same stories. “But what’s the use of a candle that casts no light?” 
“It is a lesson,” Armen said, “the last lesson we must learn before we don our maester’s chains. 
The glass candle is meant to represent truth and learning, rare and beautiful and fragile things. It 
is made in the shape of a candle to remind us that a maester must cast light wherever he serves, 
and it is sharp to remind us that knowledge can be dangerous. Wise men may grow arrogant in 
their wisdom, but a maester must always remain humble. The glass candle reminds us of that as 
well. Even after he has said his vow and donned his chain and gone forth to serve, a maester will 
think back on the darkness of his vigil and remember how nothing that he did could make the 
candle burn... for even with knowledge, some things are not possible.” 
Lazy Leo burst out laughing. “Not possible for you, you mean. I saw the candle burning with 
my own eyes.” 

“You saw some candle burning, I don’t doubt,” said Armen. “A candle of black wax, perhaps.” 
“I know what I saw. The light was queer and bright, much brighter than any beeswax or tallow 
candle. It cast strange shadows and the flame never flickered, not even when a draft blew 
through the open door behind me.” 
Armen crossed his arms. “Obsidian does not burn.” 
“Dragonglass,” Pate said. “The smallfolk call it dragonglass.” Somehow that seemed important. 
“They do,” mused Alleras, the Sphinx, “and if there are dragons in the world again...” 
“Dragons and darker things,” said Leo. “The grey sheep have closed their eyes, but the mastiff 
sees the truth. Old powers waken. Shadows stir. An age of wonder and terror will soon be upon 
us, an age for gods and heroes.” He stretched, smiling his lazy smile. “That’s worth a round, I’d 
say.” 
“We’ve drunk enough,” said Armen. “Morn will be upon us sooner than we’d like, and 
Archmaester Ebrose will be speaking on the properties of urine. Those who mean to forge a 
silver link would do well not to miss his talk.” 
“Far be it from me to keep you from the piss tasting,” said Leo. “Myself, I prefer the taste of 
Arbor gold.” 
“If the choice is piss or you, I’ll drink piss.” Mollander pushed back from the table. “Come, 
Roone.” 
The Sphinx reached for his bowcase. “It’s bed for me as well. I expect I’ll dream of dragons 
and glass candles.” 
“All of you?” Leo shrugged. “Well, Rosey will remain. Perhaps I’ll wake our little sweetmeat 
and make a woman of her.” 
Alleras saw the look on Pate’s face. “If he does not have a copper for a cup of wine, he cannot 
have a dragon for the girl.” 
“Aye,” said Mollander. “Besides, it takes a man to make a woman. Come with us, Pate. Old 
Walgrave will wake when the sun comes up. He’ll be needing you to help him to the privy.” 
If he remembers who I am today. Archmaester Walgrave had no trouble telling one raven from 
another, but he was not so good with people. Some days he seemed to think Pate was someone 
named Cressen. “Not just yet,” he told his friends. “I’m going to stay awhile.” Dawn had not 
broken, not quite. The alchemist might still be coming, and Pate meant to be here if he did. 
“As you wish,” said Armen. Alleras gave Pate a lingering look, then slung his bow over one 
slim shoulder and followed the others toward the bridge. Mollander was so drunk he had to walk 
with a hand on Roone’s shoulder to keep from falling. The Citadel was no great distance as the 
raven flies, but none of them were ravens and Oldtown was a veritable labyrinth of a city, all 
wynds and crisscrossing alleys and narrow crookback streets. “Careful,” Pate heard Armen say 
as the river mists swallowed up the four of them, “the night is damp, and the cobbles will be 
slippery.” 
When they were gone, Lazy Leo considered Pate sourly across the table. “How sad. The Sphinx 
has stolen off with all his silver, abandoning me to Spotted Pate the pig boy.” He stretched, 
yawning. “How is our lovely little Rosey, pray?” 

“She’s sleeping,” Pate said curtly. 
“Naked, I don’t doubt.” Leo grinned. “Do you think she’s truly worth a dragon? One day I 
suppose I must find out.” 
Pate knew better than to reply to that. 
Leo needed no reply. “I expect that once I’ve broken in the wench, her price will fall to where 
even pig boys will be able to afford her. You ought to thank me.” 
I ought to kill you, Pate thought, but he was not near drunk enough to throw away his life. Leo 
had been trained to arms, and was known to be deadly with bravo’s blade and dagger. And if 
Pate should somehow kill him, it would mean his own head too. Leo had two names where Pate 
had only one, and his second was Tyrell. Ser Moryn Tyrell, commander of the City Watch of 
Oldtown, was Leo’s father. Mace Tyrell, Lord of Highgarden and Warden of the South, was 
Leo’s cousin. And Oldtown’s Old Man, Lord Leyton of the Hightower, who numbered 
“Protector of the Citadel” amongst his many titles, was a sworn bannerman of House Tyrell. Let 
it go, Pate told himself. He says these things just to wound me. 
The mists were lightening to the east. Dawn, Pate realized. Dawn has come, and the alchemist 
has not. He did not know whether he should laugh or cry. Am I still a thief if I put it all back and 
no one ever knows? It was another question that he had no answer for, like those that Ebrose and 
Vaellyn had once asked him. 
When he pushed back from the bench and got to his feet, the fearsomely strong cider all went to 
his head at once. He had to put a hand on the table to steady himself. “Leave Rosey be,” he said, 
by way of parting. “Just leave her be, or I may kill you.” 
Leo Tyrell flicked the hair back from his eye. “I do not fight duels with pig boys. Go away.” 
Pate turned and crossed the terrace. His heels rang against the weathered planks of the old 
bridge. By the time he reached the other side, the eastern sky was turning pink. The world is 
wide, he told himself. If I bought that donkey, I could still wander the roads and byways of the 
Seven Kingdoms, leeching the smallfolk and picking nits out of their hair. I could sign on to 
some ship, pull an oar, and sail to Qarth by the Jade Gates to see these bloody dragons for 
myself. I do not need to go back to old Walgrave and the ravens. 
Yet somehow his feet turned back toward the Citadel. 
When the first shaft of sunlight broke through the clouds to the east, morning bells began to 
peal from the Sailor’s Sept down by the harbor. The Lord’s Sept joined in a moment later, then 
the Seven Shrines from their gardens across the Honeywine, and finally the Starry Sept that had 
been the seat of the High Septon for a thousand years before Aegon landed at King’s Landing. 
They made a mighty music. Though not so sweet as one small nightingale. 
He could hear singing too, beneath the pealing of the bells. Each morning at first light the red 
priests gathered to welcome the sun outside their modest wharfside temple. For the night is dark 
and full of terrors. Pate had heard them cry those words a hundred times, asking their god R’hllor 
to save them from the darkness. The Seven were gods enough for him, but he had heard that 
Stannis Baratheon worshiped at the nightfires now. He had even put the fiery heart of R’hllor on 
his banners in place of the crowned stag. If he should win the Iron Throne, we’ll all need to learn 

the words of the red priests’ song, Pate thought, but that was not likely. Tywin Lannister had 
smashed Stannis and R’hllor upon the Blackwater, and soon enough he would finish them and 
mount the head of the Baratheon pretender on a spike above the gates of King’s Landing. 
As the night’s mists burned away, Oldtown took form around him, emerging ghostlike from the 
predawn gloom. Pate had never seen King’s Landing, but he knew it was a daub-and-wattle city, 
a sprawl of mud streets, thatched roofs, and wooden hovels. Oldtown was built in stone, and all 
its streets were cobbled, down to the meanest alley. The city was never more beautiful than at 
break of day. West of the Honeywine, the Guildhalls lined the bank like a row of palaces. 
Upriver, the domes and towers of the Citadel rose on both sides of the river, connected by stone 
bridges crowded with halls and houses. Downstream, below the black marble walls and arched 
windows of the Starry Sept, the manses of the pious clustered like children gathered round the 
feet of an old dowager. 
And beyond, where the Honeywine widened into Whispering Sound, rose the Hightower, its 
beacon fires bright against the dawn. From where it stood atop the bluffs of Battle Island, its 
shadow cut the city like a sword. Those born and raised in Oldtown could tell the time of day by 
where that shadow fell. Some claimed a man could see all the way to the Wall from the top. 
Perhaps that was why Lord Leyton had not made the descent in more than a decade, preferring to 
rule his city from the clouds. 
A butcher’s cart rumbled past Pate down the river road, five piglets in the back squealing in 
distress. Dodging from its path, he just avoided being spattered as a townswoman emptied a pail 
of night soil from a window overhead. When I am a maester in a castle I will have a horse to 
ride, he thought. Then he tripped upon a cobble and wondered who he was fooling. There would 
be no chain for him, no seat at a lord’s high table, no tall white horse to ride. His days would be 
spent listening to ravens quork and scrubbing shit stains off Archmaester Walgrave’s 
smallclothes. 
He was on one knee, trying to wipe the mud off his robes, when a voice said, “Good morrow, 
Pate.” 
The alchemist was standing over him. 
Pate rose. “The third day... you said you would be at the Quill and Tankard.” 
“You were with your friends. It was not my wish to intrude upon your fellowship.” The 
alchemist wore a hooded traveler’s cloak, brown and nondescript. The rising sun was peeking 
over the rooftops behind his shoulder, so it was hard to make out the face beneath his hood. 
“Have you decided what you are?” 
Must he make me say it? “I suppose I am a thief.” 
“I thought you might be.” 
The hardest part had been getting down on his hands and knees to pull the strongbox from 
underneath Archmaester Walgrave’s bed. Though the box was stoutly made and bound with iron, 
its lock was broken. Maester Gormon had suspected Pate of breaking it, but that wasn’t true. 
Walgrave had broken the lock himself, after losing the key that opened it. 

Inside, Pate had found a bag of silver stags, a lock of yellow hair tied up in a ribbon, a painted 
miniature of a woman who resembled Walgrave (even to her mustache), and a knight’s gauntlet 
made of lobstered steel. The gauntlet had belonged to a prince, Walgrave claimed, though he 
could no longer seem to recall which one. When Pate shook it, the key fell out onto the floor. 
If I pick that up, I am a thief, he remembered thinking. The key was old and heavy, made of 
black iron; supposedly it opened every door at the Citadel. Only the archmaesters had such keys. 
The others carried theirs upon their person or hid them away in some safe place, but if Walgrave 
had hidden his, no one would ever have seen it again. Pate snatched up the key and had been 
halfway to the door before turning back to take the silver too. A thief was a thief, whether he 
stole a little or a lot. “Pate,” one of the white ravens had called after him, “Pate, Pate, Pate.” 
“Do you have my dragon?” he asked the alchemist. 
“If you have what I require.” 
“Give it here. I want to see.” Pate did not intend to let himself be cheated. 
“The river road is not the place. Come.” 
He had no time to think about it, to weigh his choices. The alchemist was walking away. Pate 
had to follow or lose Rosey and the dragon both, forever. He followed. As they walked, he 
slipped his hand up into his sleeve. He could feel the key, safe inside the hidden pocket he had 
sewn there. Maester’s robes were full of pockets. He had known that since he was a boy. 
He had to hurry to keep pace with the alchemist’s longer strides. They went down an alley, 
around a corner, through the old Thieves Market, along Ragpicker’s Wynd. Finally, the man 
turned into another alley, narrower than the first. “This is far enough,” said Pate. “There’s no one 
about. We’ll do it here.” 
“As you wish.” 
“I want my dragon.” 
“To be sure.” The coin appeared. The alchemist made it walk across his knuckles, the way he 
had when Rosey brought the two of them together. In the morning light the dragon glittered as it 
moved, and gave the alchemist’s fingers a golden glow. 
Pate grabbed it from his hand. The gold felt warm against his palm. He brought it to his mouth 
and bit down on it the way he’d seen men do. If truth be told, he wasn’t sure what gold should 
taste like, but he did not want to look a fool. 
“The key?” the alchemist inquired politely. 
Something made Pate hesitate. “Is it some book you want?” Some of the old Valyrian scrolls 
down in the locked vaults were said to be the only surviving copies in the world. 
“What I want is none of your concern.” 
“No.” It’s done, Pate told himself. Go. Run back to the Quill and Tankard, wake Rosey with a 
kiss, and tell her she belongs to you. Yet still he lingered. “Show me your face.” 
“As you wish.” The alchemist pulled his hood down. 
He was just a man, and his face was just a face. A young man’s face, ordinary, with full cheeks 
and the shadow of a beard. A scar showed faintly on his right cheek. He had a hooked nose, and 

a mat of dense black hair that curled tightly around his ears. It was not a face Pate recognized. “I 
do not know you.” 
“Nor I you.” 
“Who are you?” 
“A stranger. No one. Truly.” 
“Oh.” Pate had run out of words. He drew out the key and put it in the stranger’s hand, feeling 
light-headed, almost giddy. Rosey, he reminded himself. “We’re done, then.” 
He was halfway down the alley when the cobblestones began to move beneath his feet. The 
stones are slick and wet, he thought, but that was not it. He could feel his heart hammering in his 
chest. “What’s happening?” he said. His legs had turned to water. “I don’t understand.” 
“And never will,” a voice said sadly. 
The cobblestones rushed up to kiss him. Pate tried to cry for help, but his voice was failing too. 
His last thought was of Rosey. 

THE PROPHET 
The prophet was drowning men on Great Wyk when they came to tell him that the king 
was dead. 
It was a bleak, cold morning, and the sea was as leaden as the sky. The first three men had 
offered their lives to the Drowned God fearlessly, but the fourth was weak in faith and began to 
struggle as his lungs cried out for air. Standing waist-deep in the surf, Aeron seized the naked 
boy by the shoulders and pushed his head back down as he tried to snatch a breath. “Have 
courage,” he said. “We came from the sea, and to the sea we must return. Open your mouth and 
drink deep of god’s blessing. Fill your lungs with water, that you may die and be reborn. It does 
no good to fight.” 
Either the boy could not hear him with his head beneath the waves, or else his faith had utterly 
deserted him. He began to kick and thrash so wildly that Aeron had to call for help. Four of his 
drowned men waded out to seize the wretch and hold him underwater. “Lord God who drowned 
for us,” the priest prayed, in a voice as deep as the sea, “let Emmond your servant be reborn from 
the sea, as you were. Bless him with salt, bless him with stone, bless him with steel.” 
Finally, it was done. No more air was bubbling from his mouth, and all the strength had gone 
out of his limbs. Facedown in the shallow sea floated Emmond, pale and cold and peaceful. 
That was when the Damphair realized that three horsemen had joined his drowned men on the 
pebbled shore. Aeron knew the Sparr, a hatchet-faced old man with watery eyes whose quavery 
voice was law on this part of Great Wyk. His son Steffarion accompanied him, with another 
youth whose dark red fur-lined cloak was pinned at the shoulder with an ornate brooch that 
showed the black-and-gold warhorn of the Goodbrothers. One of Gorold’s sons, the priest 
decided at a glance. Three tall sons had been born to Goodbrother’s wife late in life, after a 
dozen daughters, and it was said that no man could tell one son from the others. Aeron Damphair 
did not deign to try. Whether this be Greydon or Gormond or Gran, the priest had no time for 
him. 
He growled a brusque command, and his drowned men seized the dead boy by his arms and 
legs to carry him above the tideline. The priest followed, naked but for a sealskin clout that 
covered his private parts. Goosefleshed and dripping, he splashed back onto land, across cold 
wet sand and sea-scoured pebbles. One of his drowned men handed him a robe of heavy 
roughspun dyed in mottled greens and blues and greys, the colors of the sea and the Drowned 
God. Aeron donned the robe and pulled his hair free. Black and wet, that hair; no blade had 
touched it since the sea had raised him up. It draped his shoulders like a ragged, ropy cloak, and 
fell down past his waist. Aeron wove strands of seaweed through it, and through his tangled, 
uncut beard. 
His drowned men formed a circle around the dead boy, praying. Norjen worked his arms whilst 
Rus knelt astride him, pumping on his chest, but all moved aside for Aeron. He pried apart the 
boy’s cold lips with his fingers and gave Emmond the kiss of life, and again, and again, until the 

sea came gushing from his mouth. The boy began to cough and spit, and his eyes blinked open, 
full of fear. 
Another one returned. It was a sign of the Drowned God’s favor, men said. Every other priest 
lost a man from time to time, even Tarle the Thrice-Drowned, who had once been thought so 
holy that he was picked to crown a king. But never Aeron Greyjoy. He was the Damphair, who 
had seen the god’s own watery halls and returned to tell of it. “Rise,” he told the sputtering boy 
as he slapped him on his naked back. “You have drowned and been returned to us. What is dead 
can never die.” 
“But rises.” The boy coughed violently, bringing up more water. “Rises again.” Every word 
was bought with pain, but that was the way of the world; a man must fight to live. “Rises again.” 
Emmond staggered to his feet. “Harder. And stronger.” 
“You belong to the god now,” Aeron told him. The other drowned men gathered round and 
each gave him a punch and a kiss to welcome him to the brotherhood. One helped him don a 
roughspun robe of mottled blue and green and grey. Another presented him with a driftwood 
cudgel. “You belong to the sea now, so the sea has armed you,” Aeron said. “We pray that you 
shall wield your cudgel fiercely, against all the enemies of our god.” 
Only then did the priest turn to the three riders, watching from their saddles. “Have you come to 
be drowned, my lords?” 
The Sparr coughed. “I was drowned as a boy,” he said, “and my son upon his name day.” 
Aeron snorted. That Steffarion Sparr had been given to the Drowned God soon after birth he 
had no doubt. He knew the manner of it too, a quick dip into a tub of seawater that scarce wet the 
infant’s head. Small wonder the ironborn had been conquered, they who once held sway 
everywhere the sound of waves was heard. “That is no true drowning,” he told the riders. “He 
that does not die in truth cannot hope to rise from death. Why have you come, if not to prove 
your faith?” 
“Lord Gorold’s son came seeking you, with news.” The Sparr indicated the youth in the red 
cloak. 
The boy looked to be no more than six-and-ten. “Aye, and which are you?” Aeron demanded. 
“Gormond. Gormond Goodbrother, if it please my lord.” 
“It is the Drowned God we must please. Have you been drowned, Gormond Goodbrother?” 
“On my name day, Damphair. My father sent me to find you and bring you to him. He needs to 
see you.” 
“Here I stand. Let Lord Gorold come and feast his eyes.” Aeron took a leather skin from Rus, 
freshly filled with water from the sea. The priest pulled out the cork and took a swallow. 
“I am to bring you to the keep,” insisted young Gormond, from atop his horse. 
He is afraid to dismount, lest he get his boots wet. “I have the god’s work to do.” Aeron 
Greyjoy was a prophet. He did not suffer petty lords ordering him about like some thrall. 
“Gorold’s had a bird,” said the Sparr. 
“A maester’s bird, from Pyke,” Gormond confirmed. 

Dark wings, dark words. “The ravens fly o’er salt and stone. If there are tidings that concern 
me, speak them now.” 
“Such tidings as we bear are for your ears alone, Damphair,” the Sparr said. “These are not 
matters I would speak of here before these others.” 
“These others are my drowned men, god’s servants, just as I am. I have no secrets from them, 
nor from our god, beside whose holy sea I stand.” 
The horsemen exchanged a look. “Tell him,” said the Sparr, and the youth in the red cloak 
summoned up his courage. “The king is dead,” he said, as plain as that. Four small words, yet the 
sea itself trembled when he uttered them. 
Four kings there were in Westeros, yet Aeron did not need to ask which one was meant. Balon 
Greyjoy ruled the Iron Islands, and no other. The king is dead. How can that be? Aeron had seen 
his eldest brother not a moon’s turn past, when he had returned to the Iron Islands from harrying 
the Stony Shore. Balon’s grey hair had gone half-white whilst the priest had been away, and the 
stoop in his shoulders was more pronounced than when the longships sailed. Yet all in all the 
king had not seemed ill. 
Aeron Greyjoy had built his life upon two mighty pillars. Those four small words had knocked 
one down. Only the Drowned God remains to me. May he make me as strong and tireless as the 
sea. “Tell me the manner of my brother’s death.” 
“His Grace was crossing a bridge at Pyke when he fell and was dashed upon the rocks below.” 
The Greyjoy stronghold stood upon a broken headland, its keeps and towers built atop massive 
stone stacks that thrust up from the sea. Bridges knotted Pyke together; arched bridges of carved 
stone and swaying spans of hempen rope and wooden planks. “Was the storm raging when he 
fell?” Aeron demanded of them. 
“Aye,” the youth said, “it was.” 
“The Storm God cast him down,” the priest announced. For a thousand thousand years sea and 
sky had been at war. From the sea had come the ironborn, and the fish that sustained them even 
in the depths of winter, but storms brought only woe and grief. “My brother Balon made us great 
again, which earned the Storm God’s wrath. He feasts now in the Drowned God’s watery halls, 
with mermaids to attend his every want. It shall be for us who remain behind in this dry and 
dismal vale to finish his great work.” He pushed the cork back into his waterskin. “I shall speak 
with your lord father. How far from here to Hammerhorn?” 
“Six leagues. You may ride pillion with me.” 
“One can ride faster than two. Give me your horse, and the Drowned God will bless you.” 
“Take my horse, Damphair,” offered Steffarion Sparr. 
“No. His mount is stronger. Your horse, boy.” 
The youth hesitated half a heartbeat, then dismounted and held the reins for the Damphair. 
Aeron shoved a bare black foot into a stirrup and swung himself onto the saddle. He was not 
fond of horses—they were creatures from the green lands and helped to make men weak—but 
necessity required that he ride. Dark wings, dark words. A storm was brewing, he could hear it in 

the waves, and storms brought naught but evil. “Meet with me at Pebbleton beneath Lord 
Merlyn’s tower,” he told his drowned men, as he turned the horse’s head. 
The way was rough, up hills and woods and stony defiles, along a narrow track that oft seemed 
to disappear beneath the horse’s hooves. Great Wyk was the largest of the Iron Islands, so vast 
that some of its lords had holdings that did not front upon the holy sea. Gorold Goodbrother was 
one such. His keep was in the Hardstone Hills, as far from the Drowned God’s realm as any 
place in the isles. Gorold’s folk toiled down in Gorold’s mines, in the stony dark beneath the 
earth. Some lived and died without setting eyes upon salt water. Small wonder that such folk are 
crabbed and queer. 
As Aeron rode, his thoughts turned to his brothers. 
Nine sons had been born from the loins of Quellon Greyjoy, the Lord of the Iron Islands. 
Harlon, Quenton, and Donel had been born of Lord Quellon’s first wife, a woman of the 
Stonetrees. Balon, Euron, Victarion, Urrigon, and Aeron were the sons of his second, a Sunderly 
of Saltcliffe. For a third wife Quellon took a girl from the green lands, who gave him a sickly 
idiot boy named Robin, the brother best forgotten. The priest had no memory of Quenton or 
Donel, who had died as infants. Harlon he recalled but dimly, sitting grey-faced and still in a 
windowless tower room and speaking in whispers that grew fainter every day as the greyscale 
turned his tongue and lips to stone. One day we shall feast on fish together in the Drowned God’s 
watery halls, the four of us and Urri too. 
Nine sons had been born from the loins of Quellon Greyjoy, but only four had lived to 
manhood. That was the way of this cold world, where men fished the sea and dug in the ground 
and died, whilst women brought forth short-lived children from beds of blood and pain. Aeron 
had been the last and least of the four krakens, Balon the eldest and boldest, a fierce and fearless 
boy who lived only to restore the ironborn to their ancient glory. At ten he scaled the Flint Cliffs 
to the Blind Lord’s haunted tower. At thirteen he could run a longship’s oars and dance the 
finger dance as well as any man in the isles. At fifteen he had sailed with Dagmer Cleftjaw to the 
Stepstones and spent a summer reaving. He slew his first man there and took his first two salt 
wives. At seventeen Balon captained his own ship. He was all that an elder brother ought to be, 
though he had never shown Aeron aught but scorn. I was weak and full of sin, and scorn was 
more than I deserved. Better to be scorned by Balon the Brave than beloved of Euron Crow’s 
Eye. And if age and grief had turned Balon bitter with the years, they had also made him more 
determined than any man alive. He was born a lord’s son and died a king, murdered by a jealous 
god, Aeron thought, and now the storm is coming, a storm such as these isles have never known. 
It was long after dark by the time the priest espied the spiky iron battlements of the 
Hammerhorn clawing at the crescent moon. Gorold’s keep was hulking and blocky, its great 
stones quarried from the cliff that loomed behind it. Below its walls, the entrances of caves and 
ancient mines yawned like toothless black mouths. The Hammerhorn’s iron gates had been 
closed and barred for the night. Aeron beat on them with a rock until the clanging woke a guard. 
The youth who admitted him was the image of Gormond, whose horse he’d taken. “Which one 
are you?” Aeron demanded. 

“Gran. My father awaits you within.” 
The hall was dank and drafty, full of shadows. One of Gorold’s daughters offered the priest a 
horn of ale. Another poked at a sullen fire that was giving off more smoke than heat. Gorold 
Goodbrother himself was talking quietly with a slim man in fine grey robes, who wore about his 
neck a chain of many metals that marked him for a maester of the Citadel. 
“Where is Gormond?” Gorold asked when he saw Aeron. 
“He returns afoot. Send your women away, my lord. And the maester as well.” He had no love 
of maesters. Their ravens were creatures of the Storm God, and he did not trust their healing, not 
since Urri. No proper man would choose a life of thralldom, nor forge a chain of servitude to 
wear about his throat. 
“Gysella, Gwin, leave us,” Goodbrother said curtly. “You as well, Gran. Maester Murenmure 
will stay.” 
“He will go,” insisted Aeron. 
“This is my hall, Damphair. It is not for you to say who must go and who remains. The maester 
stays.” 
The man lives too far from the sea, Aeron told himself. “Then I shall go,” he told Goodbrother. 
Dry rushes rustled underneath the cracked soles of his bare black feet as he turned and stalked 
away. It seemed he had ridden a long way for naught. 
Aeron was almost at the door when the maester cleared his throat, and said, “Euron Crow’s Eye 
sits the Seastone Chair.” 
The Damphair turned. The hall had suddenly grown colder. The Crow’s Eye is half a world 
away. Balon sent him off two years ago, and swore that it would be his life if he returned. “Tell 
me,” he said hoarsely. 
“He sailed into Lordsport the day after the king’s death, and claimed the castle and the crown as 
Balon’s eldest brother,” said Gorold Goodbrother. “Now he sends forth ravens, summoning the 
captains and the kings from every isle to Pyke, to bend their knees and do him homage as their 
king.” 
“No.” Aeron Damphair did not weigh his words. “Only a godly man may sit the Seastone 
Chair. The Crow’s Eye worships naught but his own pride.” 
“You were on Pyke not long ago, and saw the king,” said Goodbrother. “Did Balon say aught to 
you of the succession?” 
Aye. They had spoken in the Sea Tower, as the wind howled outside the windows and the 
waves crashed restlessly below. Balon had shaken his head in despair when he heard what Aeron 
had to tell him of his last remaining son. “The wolves have made a weakling of him, as I feared,” 
the king had said. “I pray god that they killed him, so he cannot stand in Asha’s way.” That was 
Balon’s blindness; he saw himself in his wild, headstrong daughter, and believed she could 
succeed him. He was wrong in that, and Aeron tried to tell him so. “No woman will ever rule the 
ironborn, not even a woman such as Asha,” he insisted, but Balon could be deaf to things he did 
not wish to hear. 

Before the priest could answer Gorold Goodbrother, the maester’s mouth flapped open once 
again. “By rights the Seastone Chair belongs to Theon, or Asha if the prince is dead. That is the 
law.” 
“Green land law,” said Aeron with contempt. “What is that to us? We are ironborn, the sons of 
the sea, chosen of the Drowned God. No woman may rule over us, nor any godless man.” 
“And Victarion?” asked Gorold Goodbrother. “He has the Iron Fleet. Will Victarion make a 
claim, Damphair?” 
“Euron is the elder brother...” began the maester. 
Aeron silenced him with a look. In little fishing towns and great stone keeps alike such a look 
from Damphair would make maids feel faint and send children shrieking to their mothers, and it 
was more than sufficient to quell the chain-neck thrall. “Euron is elder,” the priest said, “but 
Victarion is more godly.” 
“Will it come to war between them?” asked the maester. 
“Ironborn must not spill the blood of ironborn.” 
“A pious sentiment, Damphair,” said Goodbrother, “but not one that your brother shares. He 
had Sawane Botley drowned for saying that the Seastone Chair by rights belonged to Theon.” 
“If he was drowned, no blood was shed,” said Aeron. 
The maester and the lord exchanged a look. “I must send word to Pyke, and soon,” said Gorold 
Goodbrother. “Damphair, I would have your counsel. What shall it be, homage or defiance?” 
Aeron tugged his beard, and thought. I have seen the storm, and its name is Euron Crow’s Eye. 
“For now, send only silence,” he told the lord. “I must pray on this.” 
“Pray all you wish,” the maester said. “It does not change the law. Theon is the rightful heir, 
and Asha next.” 
“Silence!” Aeron roared. “Too long have the ironborn listened to you chain-neck maesters 
prating of the green lands and their laws. It is time we listened to the sea again. It is time we 
listened to the voice of god.” His own voice rang in that smoky hall, so full of power that neither 
Gorold Goodbrother nor his maester dared a reply. The Drowned God is with me, Aeron thought. 
He has shown me the way. 
Goodbrother offered him the comforts of the castle for the night, but the priest declined. He 
seldom slept beneath a castle roof, and never so far from the sea. “Comforts I shall know in the 
Drowned God’s watery halls beneath the waves. We are born to suffer, that our sufferings might 
make us strong. All that I require is a fresh horse to carry me to Pebbleton.” 
That Goodbrother was pleased to provide. He sent his son Greydon as well, to show the priest 
the shortest way through the hills down to the sea. Dawn was still an hour off when they set 
forth, but their mounts were hardy and surefooted, and they made good time despite the 
darkness. Aeron closed his eyes and said a silent prayer, and after a while began to drowse in the 
saddle. 
The sound came softly, the scream of a rusted hinge. “Urri,” he muttered, and woke, fearful. 
There is no hinge here, no door, no Urri. A flying axe took off half of Urri’s hand when he was 
ten-and-four, playing at the finger dance whilst his father and his elder brothers were away at 

war. Lord Quellon’s third wife had been a Piper of Pinkmaiden Castle, a girl with big soft breasts 
and brown doe’s eyes. Instead of healing Urri’s hand the Old Way, with fire and seawater, she 
gave him to her green land maester, who swore that he could sew back the missing fingers. He 
did that, and later he used potions and poltices and herbs, but the hand mortified and Urri took a 
fever. By the time the maester sawed his arm off, it was too late. 
Lord Quellon never returned from his last voyage; the Drowned God in his goodness granted 
him a death at sea. It was Lord Balon who came back, with his brothers Euron and Victarion. 
When Balon heard what had befallen Urri, he removed three of the maester’s fingers with a 
cook’s cleaver and sent his father’s Piper wife to sew them back on. Poltices and potions worked 
as well for the maester as they had for Urrigon. He died raving, and Lord Quellon’s third wife 
followed soon thereafter, as the midwife drew a stillborn daughter from her womb. Aeron had 
been glad. It had been his axe that sheared off Urri’s hand, whilst they danced the finger dance 
together, as friends and brothers will. 
It shamed him still to recall the years that followed Urri’s death. At six-and-ten he called 
himself a man, but in truth he had been a sack of wine with legs. He would sing, he would dance 
(but not the finger dance, never again), he would jape and jabber and make mock. He played the 
pipes, he juggled, he rode horses, and could drink more than all the Wynches and the Botleys, 
and half the Harlaws too. The Drowned God gives every man a gift, even him; no man could piss 
longer or farther than Aeron Greyjoy, as he proved at every feast. Once he bet his new longship 
against a herd of goats that he could quench a hearthfire with no more than his cock. Aeron 
feasted on goat for a year, and named the longship Golden Storm, though Balon threatened to 
hang him from her mast when he heard what sort of ram his brother proposed to mount upon her 
prow. 
In the end the Golden Storm went down off Fair Isle during Balon’s first rebellion, cut in half 
by a towering war galley called Fury when Stannis Baratheon caught Victarion in his trap and 
smashed the Iron Fleet. Yet the god was not done with Aeron, and carried him to shore. Some 
fishermen took him captive and marched him down to Lannisport in chains, and he spent the rest 
of the war in the bowels of Casterly Rock, proving that krakens can piss farther and longer than 
lions, boars, or chickens. 
That man is dead. Aeron had drowned and been reborn from the sea, the god’s own prophet. No 
mortal man could frighten him, no more than the darkness could... nor memories, the bones of 
the soul. The sound of a door opening, the scream of a rusted iron hinge. Euron has come again. 
It did not matter. He was the Damphair priest, beloved of the god. 
“Will it come to war?” asked Greydon Goodbrother as the sun was lightening the hills. “A war 
of brother against brother?” 
“If the Drowned God wills it. No godless man may sit the Seastone Chair.” The Crow’s Eye 
will fight, that is certain. No woman could defeat him, not even Asha; women were made to fight 
their battles in the birthing bed. And Theon, if he lived, was just as hopeless, a boy of sulks and 
smiles. At Winterfell he proved his worth, such that it was, but the Crow’s Eye was no crippled 

boy. The decks of Euron’s ship were painted red, to better hide the blood that soaked them. 
Victarion. The king must be Victarion, or the storm will slay us all. 
Greydon left him when the sun was up, to take the news of Balon’s death to his cousins in their 
towers at Downdelving, Crow Spike Keep, and Corpse Lake. Aeron continued on alone, up hills 
and down vales along a stony track that drew wider and more traveled as he neared the sea. In 
every village he paused to preach, and in the yards of petty lords as well. “We were born from 
the sea, and to the sea we all return,” he told them. His voice was as deep as the ocean, and 
thundered like the waves. “The Storm God in his wrath plucked Balon from his castle and cast 
him down, and now he feasts beneath the waves in the Drowned God’s watery halls.” He raised 
his hands. “Balon is dead! The king is dead! Yet a king will come again! For what is dead may 
never die, but rises again, harder and stronger! A king will rise!” 
Some of those who heard him threw down their hoes and picks to follow, so by the time he 
heard the crash of waves a dozen men walked behind his horse, touched by god and desirous of 
drowning. 
Pebbleton was home to several thousand fisherfolk, whose hovels huddled round the base of a 
square towerhouse with a turret at each corner. Twoscore of Aeron’s drowned men there awaited 
him, camped along a grey sand beach in sealskin tents and shelters built of driftwood. Their 
hands were roughened by brine, scarred by nets and lines, callused from oars and picks and axes, 
but now those hands gripped driftwood cudgels hard as iron, for the god had armed them from 
his arsenal beneath the sea. 
They had built a shelter for the priest just above the tideline. Gladly he crawled into it, after he 
had drowned his newest followers. My god, he prayed, speak to me in the rumble of the waves, 
and tell me what to do. The captains and the kings await your word. Who shall be our king in 
Balon’s place? Sing to me in the language of leviathan, that I may know his name. Tell me, O 
Lord beneath the waves, who has the strength to fight the storm on Pyke? 
Though his ride to Hammerhorn had left him weary, Aeron Damphair was restless in his 
driftwood shelter, roofed over with black weeds from the sea. The clouds rolled in to cloak the 
moon and stars, and the darkness lay as thick upon the sea as it did upon his soul. Balon favored 
Asha, the child of his body, but a woman cannot rule the ironborn. It must be Victarion. Nine 
sons had been born from the loins of Quellon Greyjoy, and Victarion was the strongest of them, 
a bull of a man, fearless and dutiful. And therein lies our danger. A younger brother owes 
obedience to an elder, and Victarion was not a man to sail against tradition. He has no love for 
Euron, though. Not since the woman died. 
Outside, beneath the snoring of his drowned men and the keening of the wind, he could hear the 
pounding of the waves, the hammer of his god calling him to battle. Aeron crept from his little 
shelter into the chill of the night. Naked he stood, pale and gaunt and tall, and naked he walked 
into the black salt sea. The water was icy cold, yet he did not flinch from his god’s caress. A 
wave smashed against his chest, staggering him. The next broke over his head. He could taste the 
salt on his lips and feel the god around him, and his ears rang with the glory of his song. Nine 
sons were born from the loins of Quellon Greyjoy, and I was the least of them, as weak and 

frightened as a girl. But no longer. That man is drowned, and the god has made me strong. The 
cold salt sea surrounded him, embraced him, reached down through his weak man’s flesh and 
touched his bones. Bones, he thought. The bones of the soul. Balon’s bones, and Urri’s. The truth 
is in our bones, for flesh decays and bone endures. And on the hill of Nagga, the bones of the 
Grey King’s Hall... 
And gaunt and pale and shivering, Aeron Damphair struggled back to the shore, a wiser man 
than he had been when he stepped into the sea. For he had found the answer in his bones, and the 
way was plain before him. The night was so cold that his body seemed to steam as he stalked 
back toward his shelter, but there was a fire burning in his heart, and sleep came easily for once, 
unbroken by the scream of iron hinges. 
When he woke the day was bright and windy. Aeron broke his fast on a broth of clams and 
seaweed cooked above a driftwood fire. No sooner had he finished than the Merlyn descended 
from his towerhouse with half a dozen guards to seek him out. “The king is dead,” the Damphair 
told him. 
“Aye. I had a bird. And now another.” The Merlyn was a bald round fleshy man who styled 
himself “Lord” in the manner of the green lands, and dressed in furs and velvets. “One raven 
summons me to Pyke, another to Ten Towers. You krakens have too many arms, you pull a man 
to pieces. What say you, priest? Where should I send my longships?” 
Aeron scowled. “Ten Towers, do you say? What kraken calls you there?” Ten Towers was the 
seat of the Lord of Harlaw. 
“The Princess Asha. She has set her sails for home. The Reader sends out ravens, summoning 
all her friends to Harlaw. He says that Balon meant for her to sit the Seastone Chair.” 
“The Drowned God shall decide who sits the Seastone Chair,” the priest said. “Kneel, that I 
might bless you.” Lord Merlyn sank to his knees, and Aeron uncorked his skin and poured a 
stream of seawater on his bald pate. “Lord God who drowned for us, let Meldred your servant be 
born again from the sea. Bless him with salt, bless him with stone, bless him with steel.” Water 
ran down Merlyn’s fat cheeks to soak his beard and fox-fur mantle. “What is dead may never 
die,” Aeron finished, “but rises again, harder and stronger.” But when Merlyn rose, he told him, 
“Stay and listen, that you may spread god’s word.” 
Three feet from the water’s edge the waves broke around a rounded granite boulder. It was 
there that Aeron Damphair stood, so all his school might see him, and hear the words he had to 
say. 
“We were born from the sea, and to the sea we all return,” he began, as he had a hundred times 
before. “The Storm God in his wrath plucked Balon from his castle and cast him down, and now 
he feasts beneath the waves.” He raised his hands. “The iron king is dead! Yet a king will come 
again! For what is dead may never die, but rises again, harder and stronger!” 
“A king shall rise!” the drowned men cried. 
“He shall. He must. But who?” The Damphair listened a moment, but only the waves gave 
answer. “Who shall be our king?” 

The drowned men began to slam their driftwood cudgels one against the other. “Damphair!” 
they cried. “Damphair King! Aeron King! Give us Damphair!” 
Aeron shook his head. “If a father has two sons and gives to one an axe and to the other a net, 
which does he intend should be the warrior?” 
“The axe is for the warrior,” Rus shouted back, “the net for a fisher of the seas.” 
“Aye,” said Aeron. “The god took me deep beneath the waves and drowned the worthless thing 
I was. When he cast me forth again he gave me eyes to see, ears to hear, and a voice to spread his 
word, that I might be his prophet and teach his truth to those who have forgotten. I was not made 
to sit upon the Seastone Chair... no more than Euron Crow’s Eye. For I have heard the god, who 
says, No godless man may sit my Seastone Chair!” 
The Merlyn crossed his arms against his chest. “Is it Asha, then? Or Victarion? Tell us, priest!” 
“The Drowned God will tell you, but not here.” Aeron pointed at the Merlyn’s fat white face. 
“Look not to me, nor to the laws of men, but to the sea. Raise your sails and unship your oars, 
my lord, and take yourself to Old Wyk. You, and all the captains and the kings. Go not to Pyke, 
to bow before the godless, nor to Harlaw, to consort with scheming women. Point your prow 
toward Old Wyk, where stood the Grey King’s Hall. In the name of the Drowned God I summon 
you. I summon all of you! Leave your halls and hovels, your castles and your keeps, and return 
to Nagga’s hill to make a kingsmoot!” 
The Merlyn gaped at him. “A kingsmoot? There has not been a true kingsmoot in...” 
“... too long a time!” Aeron cried in anguish. “Yet in the dawn of days the ironborn chose their 
own kings, raising up the worthiest amongst them. It is time we returned to the Old Way, for 
only that shall make us great again. It was a kingsmoot that chose Urras Ironfoot for High King, 
and placed a driftwood crown upon his brows. Sylas Flatnose, Harrag Hoare, the Old Kraken, the 
kingsmoot raised them all. And from this kingsmoot shall emerge a man to finish the work King 
Balon has begun and win us back our freedoms. Go not to Pyke, nor to the Ten Towers of 
Harlaw, but to Old Wyk, I say again. Seek the hill of Nagga and the bones of the Grey King’s 
Hall, for in that holy place when the moon has drowned and come again we shall make ourselves 
a worthy king, a godly king.” He raised his bony hands on high again. “Listen! Listen to the 
waves! Listen to the god! He is speaking to us, and he says, We shall have no king but from the 
kingsmoot!” 
A roar went up at that, and the drowned men beat their cudgels one against the other. “A 
kingsmoot!” they shouted. “A kingsmoot, a kingsmoot. No king but from the kingsmoot!” And 
the clamor that they made was so thunderous that surely the Crow’s Eye heard the shouts on 
Pyke, and the vile Storm God in his cloudy hall. And Aeron Damphair knew he had done well. 

THE CAPTAIN OF GUARDS 
The blood oranges are well past ripe,” the prince observed in a weary voice, when the 
captain rolled him onto the terrace. 
After that he did not speak again for hours. 
It was true about the oranges. A few had fallen to burst open on the pale pink marble. The sharp 
sweet smell of them filled Hotah’s nostrils each time he took a breath. No doubt the prince could 
smell them too, as he sat beneath the trees in the rolling chair Maester Caleotte had made for 
him, with its goose-down cushions and rumbling wheels of ebony and iron. 
For a long while the only sounds were the children splashing in the pools and fountains, and 
once a soft plop as another orange dropped onto the terrace to burst. Then, from the far side of 
the palace, the captain heard the faint drumbeat of boots on marble. 
Obara. He knew her stride; long-legged, hasty, angry. In the stables by the gates, her horse 
would be lathered, and bloody from her spurs. She always rode stallions, and had been heard to 
boast that she could master any horse in Dorne... and any man as well. The captain could hear 
other footsteps as well, the quick soft scuffing of Maester Caleotte hurrying to keep up. 
Obara Sand always walked too fast. She is chasing after something she can never catch, the 
prince had told his daughter once, in the captain’s hearing. 
When she appeared beneath the triple arch, Areo Hotah swung his longaxe sideways to block 
the way. The head was on a shaft of mountain ash six feet long, so she could not go around. “My 
lady, no farther.” His voice was a bass grumble thick with the accents of Norvos. “The prince 
does not wish to be disturbed.” 
Her face had been stone before he spoke; then it hardened. “You are in my way, Hotah.” Obara 
was the eldest Sand Snake, a big-boned woman near to thirty, with the close-set eyes and rat-
brown hair of the Oldtown whore who’d birthed her. Beneath a mottled sandsilk cloak of dun 
and gold, her riding clothes were old brown leather, worn and supple. They were the softest 
things about her. On one hip she wore a coiled whip, across her back a round shield of steel and 
copper. She had left her spear outside. For that, Areo Hotah gave thanks. Quick and strong as she 
was, the woman was no match for him, he knew... but she did not, and he had no wish to see her 
blood upon the pale pink marble. 
Maester Caleotte shifted his weight from foot to foot. “Lady Obara, I tried to tell you...” 
“Does he know that my father is dead?” Obara asked the captain, paying the maester no more 
mind than she would a fly, if any fly had been foolish enough to buzz about her head. 
“He does,” the captain said. “He had a bird.” 
Death had come to Dorne on raven wings, writ small and sealed with a blob of hard red wax. 
Caleotte must have sensed what was in that letter, for he’d given it Hotah to deliver. The prince 
thanked him, but for the longest time he would not break the seal. All afternoon he’d sat with the 
parchment in his lap, watching the children at their play. He watched until the sun went down 
and the evening air grew cool enough to drive them inside; then he watched the starlight on the 

water. It was moonrise before he sent Hotah to fetch a candle, so he might read his letter beneath 
the orange trees in the dark of night. 
Obara touched her whip. “Thousands are crossing the sands afoot to climb the Boneway, so 
they may help Ellaria bring my father home. The septs are packed to bursting, and the red priests 
have lit their temple fires. In the pillow houses women are coupling with every man who comes 
to them, and refusing any coin. In Sunspear, on the Broken Arm, along the Greenblood, in the 
mountains, out in the deep sand, everywhere, everywhere, women tear their hair and men cry out 
in rage. The same question is heard on every tongue—what will Doran do? What will his brother 
do to avenge our murdered prince?” She moved closer to the captain. “And you say, he does not 
wish to be disturbed!” 
“He does not wish to be disturbed,” Areo Hotah said again. 
The captain of guards knew the prince he guarded. Once, long ago, a callow youth had come 
from Norvos, a big broad-shouldered boy with a mop of dark hair. That hair was white now, and 
his body bore the scars of many battles... but his strength remained, and he kept his longaxe 
sharp, as the bearded priests had taught him. She shall not pass, he told himself, and said, “The 
prince is watching the children at their play. He is never to be disturbed when he is watching the 
children at their play.” 
“Hotah,” said Obara Sand, “you will remove yourself from my path, else I shall take that 
longaxe and—” 
“Captain,” came the command, from behind. “Let her pass. I will speak with her.” The prince’s 
voice was hoarse. 
Areo Hotah jerked his longaxe upright and stepped to one side. Obara gave him a lingering last 
look and strode past, the maester hurrying at her heels. Caleotte was no more than five feet tall 
and bald as an egg. His face was so smooth and fat that it was hard to tell his age, but he had 
been here before the captain, had even served the prince’s mother. Despite his age and girth, he 
was still nimble enough, and clever as they came, but meek. He is no match for any Sand Snake, 
the captain thought. 
In the shade of the orange trees, the prince sat in his chair with his gouty legs propped up before 
him, and heavy bags beneath his eyes... though whether it was grief or gout that kept him 
sleepless, Hotah could not say. Below, in the fountains and the pools, the children were still at 
their play. The youngest were no more than five, the oldest nine and ten. Half were girls and half 
were boys. Hotah could hear them splashing and shouting at each other in high, shrill voices. “It 
was not so long ago that you were one of the children in those pools, Obara,” the prince said, 
when she took one knee before his rolling chair. 
She snorted. “It has been twenty years, or near enough to make no matter. And I was not here 
long. I am the whore’s whelp, or had you forgotten?” When he did not answer, she rose again 
and put her hands upon her hips. “My father has been murdered.” 
“He was slain in single combat during a trial by battle,” Prince Doran said. “By law, that is no 
murder.” 
“He was your brother.” 

“He was.” 
“What do you mean to do about his death?” 
The prince turned his chair laboriously to face her. Though he was but two-and-fifty, Doran 
Martell seemed much older. His body was soft and shapeless beneath his linen robes, and his 
legs were hard to look upon. The gout had swollen and reddened his joints grotesquely; his left 
knee was an apple, his right a melon, and his toes had turned to dark red grapes, so ripe it seemed 
as though a touch would burst them. Even the weight of a coverlet could make him shudder, 
though he bore the pain without complaint. Silence is a prince’s friend, the captain had heard him 
tell his daughter once. Words are like arrows, Arianne. Once loosed, you cannot call them back. 
“I have written to Lord Tywin—” 
“Written? If you were half the man my father was—” 
“I am not your father.” 
“That I knew.” Obara’s voice was thick with contempt. 
“You would have me go to war.” 
“I know better. You need not even leave your chair. Let me avenge my father. You have a host 
in the Prince’s Pass. Lord Yronwood has another in the Boneway. Grant me the one and Nym the 
other. Let her ride the kingsroad, whilst I turn the marcher lords out of their castles and hook 
round to march on Oldtown.” 
“And how could you hope to hold Oldtown?” 
“It will be enough to sack it. The wealth of Hightower—” 
“Is it gold you want?” 
“It is blood I want.” 
“Lord Tywin shall deliver us the Mountain’s head.” 
“And who will deliver us Lord Tywin’s head? The Mountain has always been his pet.” 
The prince gestured toward the pools. “Obara, look at the children, if it please you.” 
“It does not please me. I’d get more pleasure from driving my spear into Lord Tywin’s belly. 
I’ll make him sing ‘The Rains of Castamere’ as I pull his bowels out and look for gold.” 
“Look,” the prince repeated. “I command you.” 
A few of the older children lay facedown upon the smooth pink marble, browning in the sun. 
Others paddled in the sea beyond. Three were building a sand castle with a great spike that 
resembled the Spear Tower of the Old Palace. A score or more had gathered in the big pool, to 
watch the battles as smaller children rode through the waist-deep shallows on the shoulders of 
the larger and tried to shove each other into the water. Every time a pair went down, the splash 
was followed by a roar of laughter. They watched a nut-brown girl yank a towheaded boy off his 
brother’s shoulders to tumble him headfirst into the pool. 
“Your father played that same game once, as I did before him,” said the prince. “We had ten 
years between us, so I had left the pools by the time he was old enough to play, but I would 
watch him when I came to visit Mother. He was so fierce, even as a boy. Quick as a water snake. 
I oft saw him topple boys much bigger than himself. He reminded me of that the day he left for 

King’s Landing. He swore that he would do it one more time, else I would never have let him 
go.” 
“Let him go?” Obara laughed. “As if you could have stopped him. The Red Viper of Dorne 
went where he would.” 
“He did. I wish I had some word of comfort to—” 
“I did not come to you for comfort.” Her voice was full of scorn. “The day my father came to 
claim me, my mother did not wish for me to go. ‘She is a girl,’ she said, ‘and I do not think that 
she is yours. I had a thousand other men.’ He tossed his spear at my feet and gave my mother the 
back of his hand across the face, so she began to weep. ‘Girl or boy, we fight our battles,’ he 
said, ‘but the gods let us choose our weapons.’ He pointed to the spear, then to my mother’s 
tears, and I picked up the spear. ‘I told you she was mine,’ my father said, and took me. My 
mother drank herself to death within the year. They say that she was weeping as she died.” Obara 
edged closer to the prince in his chair. “Let me use the spear; I ask no more.” 
“It is a deal to ask, Obara. I shall sleep on it.” 
“You have slept too long already.” 
“You may be right. I will send word to you at Sunspear.” 
“So long as the word is war.” Obara turned upon her heel and strode off as angrily as she had 
come, back to the stables for a fresh horse and another headlong gallop down the road. 
Maester Caleotte remained behind. “My prince?” the little round man asked. “Do your legs 
hurt?” 
The prince smiled faintly. “Is the sun hot?” 
“Shall I fetch a draught for the pain?” 
“No. I need my wits about me.” 
The maester hesitated. “My prince, is it... is it prudent to allow Lady Obara to return to 
Sunspear? She is certain to inflame the common people. They loved your brother well.” 
“So did we all.” He pressed his fingers to his temples. “No. You are right. I must return to 
Sunspear as well.” 
The little round man hesitated. “Is that wise?” 
“Not wise, but necessary. Best send a rider to Ricasso, and have him open my apartments in the 
Tower of the Sun. Inform my daughter Arianne that I will be there on the morrow.” 
My little princess. The captain had missed her sorely. 
“You will be seen,” the maester warned. 
The captain understood. Two years ago, when they had left Sunspear for the peace and isolation 
of the Water Gardens, Prince Doran’s gout had not been half so bad. In those days he had still 
walked, albeit slowly, leaning on a stick and grimacing with every step. The prince did not wish 
his enemies to know how feeble he had grown, and the Old Palace and its shadow city were full 
of eyes. Eyes, the captain thought, and steps he cannot climb. He would need to fly to sit atop the 
Tower of the Sun. 
“I must be seen. Someone must pour oil on the waters. Dorne must be reminded that it still has 
a prince.” He smiled wanly. “Old and gouty though he is.” 

“If you return to Sunspear, you will need to give audience to Princess Myrcella,” Caleotte said. 
“Her white knight will be with her... and you know he sends letters to his queen.” 
“I suppose he does.” 
The white knight. The captain frowned. Ser Arys had come to Dorne to attend his own princess, 
as Areo Hotah had once come with his. Even their names sounded oddly alike: Areo and Arys. 
Yet there the likeness ended. The captain had left Norvos and its bearded priests, but Ser Arys 
Oakheart still served the Iron Throne. Hotah had felt a certain sadness whenever he saw the man 
in the long snowy cloak, the times the prince had sent him down to Sunspear. One day, he 
sensed, the two of them would fight; on that day Oakheart would die, with the captain’s longaxe 
crashing through his skull. He slid his hand along the smooth ashen shaft of his axe and 
wondered if that day was drawing nigh. 
“The afternoon is almost done,” the prince was saying. “We will wait for morn. See that my 
litter is ready by first light.” 
“As you command.” Caleotte bobbed a bow. The captain stood aside to let him pass, and 
listened to his footsteps dwindle. 
“Captain?” The prince’s voice was soft. 
Hotah strode forward, one hand wrapped about his longaxe. The ash felt as smooth as a 
woman’s skin against his palm. When he reached the rolling chair he thumped its butt down hard 
to announce his presence, but the prince had eyes only for the children. “Did you have brothers, 
captain?” he asked. “Back in Norvos, when you were young? Sisters?” 
“Both,” Hotah said. “Two brothers, three sisters. I was the youngest.” The youngest, and 
unwanted. Another mouth to feed, a big boy who ate too much and soon outgrew his clothes. 
Small wonder they had sold him to the bearded priests. 
“I was the oldest,” the prince said, “and yet I am the last. After Mors and Olyvar died in their 
cradles, I gave up hope of brothers. I was nine when Elia came, a squire in service at Salt Shore. 
When the raven arrived with word that my mother had been brought to bed a month too soon, I 
was old enough to understand that meant the child would not live. Even when Lord Gargalen 
told me that I had a sister, I assured him that she must shortly die. Yet she lived, by the Mother’s 
mercy. And a year later Oberyn arrived, squalling and kicking. I was a man grown when they 
were playing in these pools. Yet here I sit, and they are gone.” 
Areo Hotah did not know what to say to that. He was only a captain of guards, and still a 
stranger to this land and its seven-faced god, even after all these years. Serve. Obey. Protect. He 
had sworn those vows at six-and-ten, the day he wed his axe. Simple vows for simple men, the 
bearded priests had said. He had not been trained to counsel grieving princes. 
He was still groping for some words to say when another orange fell with a heavy splat, no 
more than a foot from where the prince was seated. Doran winced at the sound, as if somehow it 
had hurt him. “Enough,” he sighed, “it is enough. Leave me, Areo. Let me watch the children for 
a few more hours.” 
When the sun set the air grew cool and the children went inside in search of supper, still the 
prince remained beneath his orange trees, looking out over the still pools and the sea beyond. A 

serving man brought him a bowl of purple olives, with flatbread, cheese, and chickpea paste. He 
ate a bit of it, and drank a cup of the sweet, heavy strongwine that he loved. When it was empty, 
he filled it once again. Sometimes in the deep black hours of the morning sleep found him in his 
chair. Only then did the captain roll him down the moonlit gallery, past a row of fluted pillars 
and through a graceful archway, to a great bed with crisp cool linen sheets in a chamber by the 
sea. Doran groaned as the captain moved him, but the gods were good and he did not wake. 
The captain’s sleeping cell adjoined his prince’s. He sat upon the narrow bed and found his 
whetstone and oilcloth in their niche, and set to work. Keep your longaxe sharp, the bearded 
priests had told him, the day they branded him. He always did. 
As he honed the axe, Hotah thought of Norvos, the high city on the hill and the low beside the 
river. He could still recall the sounds of the three bells, the way that Noom’s deep peals set his 
very bones to shuddering, the proud strong voice of Narrah, sweet Nyel’s silvery laughter. The 
taste of wintercake filled his mouth again, rich with ginger and pine nuts and bits of cherry, with 
nahsa to wash it down, fermented goat’s milk served in an iron cup and laced with honey. He 
saw his mother in her dress with the squirrel collar, the one she wore but once each year, when 
they went to see the bears dance down the Sinner’s Steps. And he smelled the stench of burning 
hair as the bearded priest touched the brand to the center of his chest. The pain had been so fierce 
that he thought his heart might stop, yet Areo Hotah had not flinched. The hair had never grown 
back over the axe. 
Only when both edges were sharp enough to shave with did the captain lay his ash-and-iron 
wife down on the bed. Yawning, he pulled off his soiled clothes, tossed them on the floor, and 
stretched out on his straw-stuffed mattress. Thinking of the brand had made it itch, so he had to 
scratch himself before he closed his eyes. I should have gathered up the oranges that fell, he 
thought, and went to sleep dreaming of the tart sweet taste of them, and the sticky feel of the red 
juice on his fingers. 
Dawn came too soon. Outside the stables the smallest of the three horse litters stood ready, the 
cedarwood litter with the red silk draperies. The captain chose twenty spears to accompany it, 
out of the thirty who were posted at the Water Gardens; the rest would stay to guard the grounds 
and children, some of whom were the sons and daughters of great lords and wealthy merchants. 
Although the prince had spoken of departing at first light, Areo Hotah knew that he would 
dawdle. Whilst the maester helped Doran Martell to bathe and bandaged up his swollen joints in 
linen wraps soaked with soothing lotions, the captain donned a shirt of copper scales as befit his 
rank, and a billowing cloak of dun-and-yellow sandsilk to keep the sun off the copper. The day 
promised to be hot, and the captain had long ago discarded the heavy horsehair cape and studded 
leather tunic he had worn in Norvos, which were like to cook a man in Dorne. He had kept his 
iron halfhelm, with its crest of sharpened spikes, but now he wore it wrapped in orange silk, 
weaving the cloth in and around the spikes. Elsewise the sun beating down on the metal would 
have his head pounding before they saw the palace. 
The prince was still not ready to depart. He had decided to break his fast before he went, with a 
blood orange and a plate of gull’s eggs diced with bits of ham and fiery peppers. Then nought 

would do but he must say farewell to several of the children who had become especial favorites: 
the Dalt boy and Lady Blackmont’s brood and the round-faced orphan girl whose father had sold 
cloth and spices up and down the Greenblood. Doran kept a splendid Myrish blanket over his 
legs as he spoke with them, to spare the young ones the sight of his swollen, bandaged joints. 
It was midday before they got under way; the prince in his litter, Maester Caleotte riding on a 
donkey, the rest afoot. Five spearmen walked ahead and five behind, with five more flanking the 
litter to either side. Areo Hotah himself took his familiar place at the left hand of the prince, 
resting his longaxe on a shoulder as he walked. The road from Sunspear to the Water Gardens 
ran beside the sea, so they had a cool fresh breeze to soothe them as they made their way across a 
sparse red-brown land of stone and sand and twisted stunted trees. 
Halfway there, the second Sand Snake caught them. 
She appeared suddenly upon a dune, mounted on a golden sand steed with a mane like fine 
white silk. Even ahorse, the Lady Nym looked graceful, dressed all in shimmering lilac robes and 
a great silk cape of cream and copper that lifted at every gust of wind, and made her look as if 
she might take flight. Nymeria Sand was five-and-twenty, and slender as a willow. Her straight 
black hair, worn in a long braid bound up with red-gold wire, made a widow’s peak above her 
dark eyes, just as her father’s had. With her high cheekbones, full lips, and milk-pale skin, she 
had all the beauty that her elder sister lacked... but Obara’s mother had been an Oldtown whore, 
whilst Nym was born from the noblest blood of old Volantis. A dozen mounted spearmen tailed 
her, their round shields gleaming in the sun. They followed her down the dune. 
The prince had tied back the curtains on his litter, the better to enjoy the breeze blowing off the 
sea. Lady Nym fell in beside him, slowing her pretty golden mare to match the litter’s pace. 
“Well met, Uncle,” she sang out, as if it had been chance that brought her here. “May I ride with 
you to Sunspear?” The captain was on the opposite side of the litter from Lady Nym, yet he 
could hear every word she said. 
“I would be glad of it,” Prince Doran replied, though he did not sound glad to the captain’s ears. 
“Gout and grief make poor companions on the road.” By which the captain knew him to mean 
that every pebble drove a spike through his swollen joints. 
“The gout I cannot help,” she said, “but my father had no use for grief. Vengeance was more to 
his taste. Is it true that Gregor Clegane admitted slaying Elia and her children?” 
“He roared out his guilt for all the court to hear,” the prince admitted. “Lord Tywin has 
promised us his head.” 
“And a Lannister always pays his debts,” said Lady Nym, “yet it seems to me that Lord Tywin 
means to pay us with our own coin. I had a bird from our sweet Ser Daemon, who swears my 
father tickled that monster more than once as they fought. If so, Ser Gregor is as good as dead, 
and no thanks to Tywin Lannister.” 
The prince grimaced. Whether it was from the pain of gout or his niece’s words, the captain 
could not say. “It may be so.” 
“May be? I say ’tis.” 
“Obara would have me go to war.” 

Nym laughed. “Yes, she wants to set the torch to Oldtown. She hates that city as much as our 
little sister loves it.” 
“And you?” 
Nym glanced over a shoulder, to where her companions rode a dozen lengths behind. “I was 
abed with the Fowler twins when the word reached me,” the captain heard her say. “You know 
the Fowler words? Let Me Soar! That is all I ask of you. Let me soar, Uncle. I need no mighty 
host, only one sweet sister.” 
“Obara?” 
“Tyene. Obara is too loud. Tyene is so sweet and gentle that no man will suspect her. Obara 
would make Oldtown our father’s funeral pyre, but I am not so greedy. Four lives will suffice for 
me. Lord Tywin’s golden twins, as payment for Elia’s children. The old lion, for Elia herself. 
And last of all the little king, for my father.” 
“The boy has never wronged us.” 
“The boy is a bastard born of treason, incest, and adultery, if Lord Stannis can be believed.” 
The playful tone had vanished from her voice, and the captain found himself watching her 
through narrowed eyes. Her sister Obara wore her whip upon her hip and carried a spear where 
any man could see it. Lady Nym was no less deadly, though she kept her knives well hidden. 
“Only royal blood can wash out my father’s murder.” 
“Oberyn died during single combat, fighting in a matter that was none of his concern. I do not 
call that murder.” 
“Call it what you will. We sent them the finest man in Dorne, and they are sending back a bag 
of bones.” 
“He went beyond anything I asked of him. ‘Take the measure of this boy king and his council, 
and make note of their strengths and weaknesses,’ I told him, on the terrace. We were eating 
oranges. ‘Find us friends, if there are any to be found. Learn what you can of Elia’s end, but see 
that you do not provoke Lord Tywin unduly,’ those were my words to him. Oberyn laughed, and 
said, ‘When have I provoked any man... unduly? You would do better to warn the Lannisters 
against provoking me.’ He wanted justice for Elia, but he would not wait—” 
“He waited ten-and-seven years,” the Lady Nym broke in. “Were it you they’d killed, my father 
would have led his banners north before your corpse was cold. Were it you, the spears would be 
falling thick as rain upon the marches now.” 
“I do not doubt it.” 
“No more should you doubt this, my prince—my sisters and I shall not wait ten-and-seven 
years for our vengeance.” She put her spurs into the mare and she was off, galloping toward 
Sunspear with her tail in hot pursuit. 
The prince leaned back against his pillows and closed his eyes, but Hotah knew he did not 
sleep. He is in pain. For a moment he considered calling Maester Caleotte up to the litter, but if 
Prince Doran had wanted him, he would have called himself. 
The shadows of the afternoon were long and dark and the sun was as red and swollen as the 
prince’s joints before they glimpsed the towers of Sunspear to the east. First the slender Spear 

Tower, a hundred-and-a-half feet tall and crowned with a spear of gilded steel that added another 
thirty feet to its height; then the mighty Tower of the Sun, with its dome of gold and leaded 
glass; last the dun-colored Sandship, looking like some monstrous dromond that had washed 
ashore and turned to stone. 
Only three leagues of coast road divided Sunspear from the Water Gardens, yet they were two 
different worlds. There children frolicked naked in the sun, music played in tiled courtyards, and 
the air was sharp with the smell of lemons and blood oranges. Here the air smelled of dust, 
sweat, and smoke, and the nights were alive with the babble of voices. In place of the pink 
marble of the Water Gardens, Sunspear was built from mud and straw, and colored brown and 
dun. The ancient stronghold of House Martell stood at the easternmost end of a little jut of stone 
and sand, surrounded on three sides by the sea. To the west, in the shadows of Sunspear’s 
massive walls, mud-brick shops and windowless hovels clung to the castle like barnacles to a 
galley’s hull. Stables and inns and winesinks and pillow houses had grown up west of those, 
many enclosed by walls of their own, and yet more hovels had risen beneath those walls. And so 
and so and so, as the bearded priests would say. Compared to Tyrosh or Myr or Great Norvos, 
the shadow city was no more than a town, yet it was the nearest thing to a true city that these 
Dornish had. 
Lady Nym’s arrival had preceded theirs by some hours, and no doubt she had warned the 
guards of their coming, for the Threefold Gate was open when they reached it. Only here were 
the gates lined up one behind the other to allow visitors to pass beneath all three of the Winding 
Walls directly to the Old Palace, without first making their way through miles of narrow alleys, 
hidden courts, and noisy bazaars. 
Prince Doran had closed the draperies of his litter as soon as the Spear Tower came in sight, yet 
still the smallfolk shouted out to him as the litter passed. The Sand Snakes have stirred them to a 
boil, the captain thought uneasily. They crossed the squalor of the outer crescent and went 
through the second gate. Beyond, the wind stank of tar and salt water and rotting seaweed, and 
the crowd grew thicker with every step. “Make way for Prince Doran!” Areo Hotah boomed out, 
thumping the butt of his longaxe on the bricks. “Make way for the Prince of Dorne!” 
“The prince is dead!” a woman shrilled behind him. 
“To spears!” a man bellowed from a balcony. 
“Doran!” called some highborn voice. “To the spears!” 
Hotah gave up looking for the speakers; the press was too thick, and a third of them were 
shouting. “To spears! Vengeance for the Viper!” By the time they reached the third gate, the 
guards were shoving people aside to clear a path for the prince’s litter, and the crowd was 
throwing things. One ragged boy darted past the spearmen with a half-rotten pomegranate in one 
hand, but when he saw Areo Hotah in his path, with longaxe at the ready, he let the fruit fall 
unthrown and beat a quick retreat. Others farther back let fly with lemons, limes, and oranges, 
crying “War! War! To the spears!” One of the guards was hit in the eye with a lemon, and the 
captain himself had an orange splatter off his foot. 

No answer came from within the litter. Doran Martell stayed cloaked within his silken walls 
until the thicker walls of the castle swallowed all of them, and the portcullis came down behind 
them with a rattling crunch. The sounds of shouting dwindled away slowly. Princess Arianne 
was waiting in the outer ward to greet her father, with half the court about her: the old blind 
seneschal Ricasso, Ser Manfrey Martell the castellan, young Maester Myles with his grey robes 
and silky perfumed beard, twoscore of Dornish knights in flowing linen of half a hundred hues. 
Little Myrcella Baratheon stood with her septa and Ser Arys of the Kingsguard, sweltering in his 
white-enameled scales. 
Princess Arianne strode to the litter on snakeskin sandals laced up to her thighs. Her hair was a 
mane of jet-black ringlets that fell to the small of her back, and around her brow was a band of 
copper suns. She is still a little thing, the captain thought. Where the Sand Snakes were tall, 
Arianne took after her mother, who stood but five foot two. Yet beneath her jeweled girdle and 
loose layers of flowing purple silk and yellow samite she had a woman’s body, lush and roundly 
curved. “Father,” she announced as the curtains opened, “Sunspear rejoices at your return.” 
“Yes, I heard the joy.” The prince smiled wanly and cupped his daughter’s cheek with a 
reddened, swollen hand. “You look well. Captain, be so good as to help me down from here.” 
Hotah slid his longaxe into its sling across his back and gathered the prince into his arms, 
tenderly so as not to jar his swollen joints. Even so, Doran Martell bit back a gasp of pain. 
“I have commanded the cooks to prepare a feast for this evening,” Arianne said, “with all your 
favorite dishes.” 
“I fear I could not do them justice.” The prince glanced slowly around the yard. “I do not see 
Tyene.” 
“She begs a private word. I sent her to the throne room to await your coming.” 
The prince sighed. “Very well. Captain? The sooner I am done with this, the sooner I may rest.” 
Hotah bore him up the long stone steps of the Tower of the Sun, to the great round chamber 
beneath the dome, where the last light of the afternoon was slanting down through thick windows 
of many-colored glass to dapple the pale marble with diamonds of half a hundred colors. There 
the third Sand Snake awaited them. 
She was sitting cross-legged on a pillow beneath the raised dais where the high seats stood, but 
she rose as they entered, dressed in a clinging gown of pale blue samite with sleeves of Myrish 
lace that made her look as innocent as the Maid herself. In one hand was a piece of embroidery 
she had been working on, in the other a pair of golden needles. Her hair was gold as well, and 
her eyes were deep blue pools... and yet somehow they reminded the captain of her father’s eyes, 
though Oberyn’s had been as black as night. All of Prince Oberyn’s daughters have his viper 
eyes, Hotah realized suddenly. The color does not matter. 
“Uncle,” said Tyene Sand, “I have been waiting for you.” 
“Captain, help me to the high seat.” 
There were two seats on the dais, near twin to one another, save that one had the Martell spear 
inlaid in gold upon its back, whilst the other bore the blazing Rhoynish sun that had flown from 

the masts of Nymeria’s ships when first they came to Dorne. The captain placed the prince 
beneath the spear and stepped away. 
“Does it hurt so much?” Lady Tyene’s voice was gentle, and she looked as sweet as summer 
strawberries. Her mother had been a septa, and Tyene had an air of almost otherworldy 
innocence about her. “Is there aught that I might do to ease your pain?” 
“Say what you would and let me rest. I am weary, Tyene.” 
“I made this for you, Uncle.” Tyene unfolded the piece she’d been embroidering. It showed her 
father, Prince Oberyn, mounted on a sand steed and armored all in red, smiling. “When I finish, 
it is yours, to help you remember him.” 
“I am not like to forget your father.” 
“That is good to know. Many have wondered.” 
“Lord Tywin has promised us the Mountain’s head.” 
“He is so kind... but a headsman’s sword is no fit end for brave Ser Gregor. We have prayed so 
long for his death, it is only fair that he pray for it as well. I know the poison that my father used, 
and there is none slower or more agonizing. Soon we may hear the Mountain screaming, even 
here in Sunspear.” 
Prince Doran sighed. “Obara cries to me for war. Nym will be content with murder. And you?” 
“War,” said Tyene, “though not my sister’s war. Dornishmen fight best at home, so I say let us 
hone our spears and wait. When the Lannisters and the Tyrells come down on us, we shall bleed 
them in the passes and bury them beneath the blowing sands, as we have a hundred times 
before.” 
“If they should come down on us.” 
“Oh, but they must, or see the realm riven once more, as it was before we wed the dragons. 
Father told me so. He said we had the Imp to thank, for sending us Princess Myrcella. She is so 
pretty, don’t you think? I wish that I had curls like hers. She was made to be a queen, just like 
her mother.” Dimples bloomed in Tyene’s cheeks. “I would be honored to arrange the wedding, 
and to see to the making of the crowns as well. Trystane and Myrcella are so innocent, I thought 
perhaps white gold... with emeralds, to match Myrcella’s eyes. Oh, diamonds and pearls would 
serve as well, so long as the children are wed and crowned. Then we need only hail Myrcella as 
the First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men, and lawful heir to 
the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, and wait for the lions to come.” 
“The lawful heir?” The prince snorted. 
“She is older than her brother,” explained Tyene, as if he were some fool. “By law the Iron 
Throne should pass to her.” 
“By Dornish law.” 
“When good King Daeron wed Princess Myriah and brought us into his kingdom, it was agreed 
that Dornish law would always rule in Dorne. And Myrcella is in Dorne, as it happens.” 
“So she is.” His tone was grudging. “Let me think on it.” 
Tyene grew cross. “You think too much, Uncle.” 
“Do I?” 

“Father said so.” 
“Oberyn thought too little.” 
“Some men think because they are afraid to do.” 
“There is a difference between fear and caution.” 
“Oh, I must pray that I never see you frightened, Uncle. You might forget to breathe.” She 
raised a hand... 
The captain brought the butt of his longaxe down upon the marble with a thump. “My lady, you 
presume. Step from the dais, if it please you.” 
“I meant no harm, Captain. I love my uncle, as I know he loved my father.” Tyene went to one 
knee before the prince. “I have said all I came to say, Uncle. Forgive me if I gave offense; my 
heart is broken all to pieces. Do I still have your love?” 
“Always.” 
“Give me your blessing, then, and I shall go.” 
Doran hesitated half a heartbeat before placing his hand on his niece’s head. “Be brave, child.” 
“Oh, how not? I am his daughter.” 
No sooner had she taken her leave than Maester Caleotte hurried to the dais. “My prince, she 
did not... here, let me see your hand.” He examined the palm first, then gently turned it upside 
down to sniff at the back of the prince’s fingers. “No, good. That is good. There are no scratches, 
so...” 
The prince withdrew his hand. “Maester, could I trouble you for some milk of the poppy? A 
thimble cup will suffice.” 
“The poppy. Yes, to be sure.” 
“Now, I think,” Doran Martell urged gently, and Caleotte scurried to the stairs. 
Outside the sun had set. The light within the dome was the blue of dusk, and all the diamonds 
on the floor were dying. The prince sat in his high seat beneath the Martell spear, his face pale 
with pain. After a long silence he turned to Areo Hotah. “Captain,” he said, “how loyal are my 
guards?” 
“Loyal.” The captain did not know what else to say. 
“All of them? Or some?” 
“They are good men. Good Dornishmen. They will do as I command.” He thumped his longaxe 
on the floor. “I will bring the head of any man who would betray you.” 
“I want no heads. I want obedience.” 
“You have it.” Serve. Obey. Protect. Simple vows for a simple man. “How many men are 
needed?” 
“I will leave that for you to decide. It may be that a few good men will serve us better than a 
score. I want this done as quickly and as quietly as possible, with no blood spilled.” 
“Quick and quiet and bloodless, aye. What is your command?” 
“You will find my brother’s daughters, take them into custody, and confine them in the cells 
atop the Spear Tower.” 

“The Sand Snakes?” The captain’s throat was dry. “All... all eight, my prince? The little ones, 
also?” 
The prince considered. “Ellaria’s girls are too young to be a danger, but there are those who 
might seek to use them against me. It would be best to keep them safe in hand. Yes, the little 
ones as well... but first secure Tyene, Nymeria, and Obara.” 
“As my prince commands.” His heart was troubled. My little princess will mislike this. “What 
of Sarella? She is a woman grown, almost twenty.” 
“Unless she returns to Dorne, there’s naught I can do about Sarella save pray that she shows 
more sense than her sisters. Leave her to her... game. Gather up the others. I shall not sleep until 
I know that they are safe and under guard.” 
“It will be done.” The captain hesitated. “When this is known in the streets, the common folk 
will howl.” 
“All Dorne will howl,” said Doran Martell in a tired voice. “I only pray Lord Tywin hears them 
in King’s Landing, so he might know what a loyal friend he has in Sunspear.” 

CERSEI 
She dreamt she sat the Iron Throne, high above them all. 
The courtiers were brightly colored mice below. Great lords and proud ladies knelt before her. 
Bold young knights laid their swords at her feet and pleaded for her favors, and the queen smiled 
down at them. Until the dwarf appeared as if from nowhere, pointing at her and howling with 
laughter. The lords and ladies began to chuckle too, hiding their smiles behind their hands. Only 
then did the queen realize she was naked. 
Horrified, she tried to cover herself with her hands. The barbs and blades of the Iron Throne bit 
into her flesh as she crouched to hide her shame. Blood ran red down her legs, as steel teeth 
gnawed at her buttocks. When she tried to stand, her foot slipped through a gap in the twisted 
metal. The more she struggled the more the throne engulfed her, tearing chunks of flesh from her 
breasts and belly, slicing at her arms and legs until they were slick and red, glistening. 
And all the while her brother capered below, laughing. 
His merriment still echoed in her ears when she felt a light touch on her shoulder, and woke 
suddenly. For half a heartbeat the hand seemed part of the nightmare, and Cersei cried out, but it 
was only Senelle. The maid’s face was white and frightened. 
We are not alone, the queen realized. Shadows loomed around her bed, tall shapes with 
chainmail glimmering beneath their cloaks. Armed men had no business here. Where are my 
guards? Her bedchamber was dark, but for the lantern one of the intruders held on high. I must 
show no fear. Cersei pushed back sleep-tousled hair, and said, “What do you want of me?” A 
man stepped into the lantern light, and she saw his cloak was white. “Jaime?” I dreamt of one 
brother, but the other has come to wake me. 
“Your Grace.” The voice was not her brother’s. “The Lord Commander said come get you.” His 
hair curled, as Jaime’s did, but her brother’s hair was beaten gold, like hers, where this man’s 
was black and oily. She stared at him, confused, as he muttered about a privy and a crossbow, 
and said her father’s name. I am dreaming still, Cersei thought. I have not woken, nor has my 
nightmare ended. Tyrion will creep out from under the bed soon and begin to laugh at me. 
But that was folly. Her dwarf brother was down in the black cells, condemned to die this very 
day. She looked down at her hands, turning them over to make certain all her fingers were still 
there. When she ran a hand down her arm the skin was covered with gooseprickles, but 
unbroken. There were no cuts on her legs, no gashes on the soles of her feet. A dream, that’s all 
it was, a dream. I drank too much last night, these fears are only humors born of wine. I will be 
the one laughing, come dusk. My children will be safe, Tommen’s throne will be secure, and my 
twisted little valonqar will be short a head and rotting. 
Jocelyn Swyft was at her elbow, pressing a cup on her. Cersei took a sip: water, mixed with 
lemon squeezings, so tart she spit it out. She could hear the night wind rattling the shutters, and 
she saw with a strange sharp clarity. Jocelyn was trembling like a leaf, as frightened as Senelle. 
Ser Osmund Kettleblack loomed over her. Behind him stood Ser Boros Blount, with a lantern. At 

the door were Lannister guardsmen with gilded lions shining on the crests of their helmets. They 
looked afraid as well. Can it be? the queen wondered. Can it be true? 
She rose, and let Senelle slip a bedrobe over her shoulders to hide her nakedness. Cersei belted 
it herself, her fingers stiff and clumsy. “My lord father keeps guards about him, night and day,” 
she said. Her tongue felt thick. She took another swallow of lemon water and sloshed it round 
her mouth to freshen her breath. A moth had gotten into the lantern Ser Boros was holding; she 
could hear it buzzing and see the shadow of its wings as it beat against the glass. 
“The guards were at their posts, Your Grace,” said Osmund Kettleblack. “We found a hidden 
door behind the hearth. A secret passage. The Lord Commander’s gone down to see where it 
goes.” 
“Jaime?” Terror seized her, sudden as a storm. “Jaime should be with the king...” 
“The lad’s not been harmed. Ser Jaime sent a dozen men to look in on him. His Grace is 
sleeping peaceful.” 
Let him have a sweeter dream than mine, and a kinder waking. “Who is with the king?” 
“Ser Loras has that honor, if it please you.” 
It did not please her. The Tyrells were only stewards that the dragon-kings had upjumped far 
above their station. Their vanity was exceeded only by their ambition. Ser Loras might be as 
pretty as a maiden’s dream, but underneath his white cloak he was Tyrell to the bone. For all she 
knew, this night’s foul fruit had been planted and nurtured in Highgarden. 
But that was a suspicion she dare not speak aloud. “Allow me a moment to dress. Ser Osmund, 
you shall accompany me to the Tower of the Hand. Ser Boros, roust the gaolers and make certain 
the dwarf is still in his cell.” She would not say his name. He would never have found the 
courage to lift a hand against Father, she told herself, but she had to be certain. 
“As Your Grace commands.” Blount surrendered the lantern to Ser Osmund. Cersei was not 
displeased to see the back of him. Father should never have restored him to the white. The man 
had proved himself a craven. 
By the time they left Maegor’s Holdfast, the sky had turned a deep cobalt blue, though the stars 
still shone. All but one, Cersei thought. The bright star of the west has fallen, and the nights will 
be darker now. She paused upon the drawbridge that spanned the dry moat, gazing down at the 
spikes below. They would not dare lie to me about such a thing. “Who found him?” 
“One of his guards,” said Ser Osmund. “Lum. He felt a call of nature, and found his lordship in 
the privy.” 
No, that cannot be. That is not the way a lion dies. The queen felt strangely calm. She 
remembered the first time she had lost a tooth, when she was just a little girl. It hadn’t hurt, but 
the hole in her mouth felt so odd she could not stop touching it with her tongue. Now there is a 
hole in the world where Father stood, and holes want filling. 
If Tywin Lannister was truly dead, no one was safe... least of all her son upon his throne. When 
the lion falls the lesser beasts move in: the jackals and the vultures and the feral dogs. They 
would try to push her aside, as they always had. She would need to move quickly, as she had 
when Robert died. This might be the work of Stannis Baratheon, through some catspaw. It could 

well be the prelude to another attack upon the city. She hoped it was. Let him come. I will smash 
him, just as Father did, and this time he will die. Stannis did not frighten her, no more than Mace 
Tyrell did. No one frightened her. She was a daughter of the Rock, a lion. There will be no more 
talk of forcing me to wed again. Casterly Rock was hers now, and all the power of House 
Lannister. No one would ever disregard her again. Even when Tommen had no further need of a 
regent, the Lady of Casterly Rock would remain a power in the land. 
The rising sun had painted the tower tops a vivid red, but beneath the walls the night still 
huddled. The outer castle was so hushed that she could have believed all its people dead. They 
should be. It is not fitting for Tywin Lannister to die alone. Such a man deserves a retinue to 
attend his needs in hell. 
Four spearmen in red cloaks and lion-crested helms were posted at the door of the Tower of the 
Hand. “No one is to enter or leave without my permission,” she told them. The command came 
easily to her. My father had steel in his voice as well. 
Within the tower, the smoke from the torches irritated her eyes, but Cersei did not weep, no 
more than her father would have. I am the only true son he ever had. Her heels scraped against 
the stone as she climbed, and she could still hear the moth fluttering wildly inside Ser Osmund’s 
lantern. Die, the queen thought at it, in irritation, fly into the flame and be done with it. 
Two more red-cloaked guardsmen stood atop the steps. Red Lester muttered a condolence as 
she passed. The queen’s breath was coming fast and short, and she could feel her heart fluttering 
in her chest. The steps, she told herself, this cursed tower has too many steps. She had half a 
mind to tear it down. 
The hall was full of fools speaking in whispers, as if Lord Tywin were asleep and they were 
afraid to wake him. Guards and servants alike shrank back before her, mouths flapping. She saw 
their pink gums and waggling tongues, but their words made no more sense than the buzzing of 
the moth. What are they doing here? How did they know? By rights they should have called her 
first. She was the Queen Regent, had they forgotten that? 
Before the Hand’s bedchamber stood Ser Meryn Trant in his white armor and cloak. The visor 
of his helm was open, and the bags beneath his eyes made him look still half-asleep. “Clear these 
people away,” Cersei told him. “Is my father in the privy?” 
“They carried him back to his bed, m’lady.” Ser Meryn pushed the door open for her to enter. 
Morning light slashed through the shutters to paint golden bars upon the rushes strewn across 
the floor of the bedchamber. Her uncle Kevan was on his knees beside the bed, trying to pray, 
but he could scarcely get the words out. Guardsmen clustered near the hearth. The secret door 
that Ser Osmund had spoken of gaped open behind the ashes, no bigger than an oven. A man 
would need to crawl. But Tyrion is only half a man. The thought made her angry. No, the dwarf 
is locked in a black cell. This could not be his work. Stannis, she told herself, Stannis was behind 
it. He still has adherents in the city. Him, or the Tyrells... 
There had always been talk of secret passages within the Red Keep. Maegor the Cruel was 
supposed to have killed the men who built the castle to keep the knowledge of them secret. How 
many other bedchambers have hidden doors? Cersei had a sudden vision of the dwarf crawling 

out from behind a tapestry in Tommen’s bedchamber with blade in hand. Tommen is well 
guarded, she told herself. But Lord Tywin had been well guarded too. 
For a moment she did not recognize the dead man. He had hair like her father, yes, but this was 
some other man, surely, a smaller man, and much older. His bedrobe was hiked up around his 
chest, leaving him naked below the waist. The quarrel had taken him in his groin between his 
navel and his manhood, and was sunk so deep that only the fletching showed. His pubic hair was 
stiff with dried blood. More was congealing in his navel. 
The smell of him made her wrinkle her nose. “Take the quarrel out of him,” she commanded. 
“This is the King’s Hand!” And my father. My lord father. Should I scream and tear my hair? 
They said Catelyn Stark had clawed her own face to bloody ribbons when the Freys slew her 
precious Robb. Would you like that, Father? she wanted to ask him. Or would you want me to be 
strong? Did you weep for your own father? Her grandfather had died when she was only a year 
old, but she knew the story. Lord Tytos had grown very fat, and his heart burst one day when he 
was climbing the steps to his mistress. Her father was off in King’s Landing when it happened, 
serving as the Mad King’s Hand. Lord Tywin was often away in King’s Landing when she and 
Jaime were young. If he wept when they brought him word of his father’s death, he did it where 
no one could see the tears. 
The queen could feel her nails digging into her palms. “How could you leave him like this? My 
father was Hand to three kings, as great a man as ever strode the Seven Kingdoms. The bells 
must ring for him, as they rang for Robert. He must be bathed and dressed as befits his stature, in 
ermine and cloth-of-gold and crimson silk. Where is Pycelle? Where is Pycelle?” She turned to 
the guardsmen. “Puckens, bring Grand Maester Pycelle. He must see to Lord Tywin.” 
“He’s seen him, Your Grace,” said Puckens. “He came and saw and went, to summon the silent 
sisters.” 
They sent for me last. The realization made her almost too angry for words. And Pycelle runs 
off to send a message rather than soil his soft, wrinkled hands. The man is useless. “Find Maester 
Ballabar,” she commanded. “Find Maester Frenken. Any of them.” Puckens and Shortear ran to 
obey. “Where is my brother?” 
“Down the tunnel. There’s a shaft, with iron rungs set in the stone. Ser Jaime went to see how 
deep it goes.” 
He has only one hand, she wanted to shout at them. One of you should have gone. He has no 
business climbing ladders. The men who murdered Father might be down there, waiting for him. 
Her twin had always been too rash, and it would seem that even losing a hand had not taught him 
caution. She was about to command the guards to go down after him and bring him back when 
Puckens and Shortear returned with a grey-haired man between them. “Your Grace,” said 
Shortear, “this here claims he was a maester.” 
The man bowed low. “How may I serve Your Grace?” 
His face was vaguely familiar, though Cersei could not place him. Old, but not so old as 
Pycelle. This one has some strength in him still. He was tall, though slightly stooped, with 
crinkles around his bold blue eyes. His throat is naked. “You wear no maester’s chain.” 

“It was taken from me. My name is Qyburn, if it please Your Grace. I treated your brother’s 
hand.” 
“His stump, you mean.” She remembered him now. He had come with Jaime from Harrenhal. 
“I could not save Ser Jaime’s hand, it is true. My arts saved his arm, however, mayhaps his very 
life. The Citadel took my chain, but they could not take my knowledge.” 
“You may suffice,” she decided. “If you fail me you will lose more than a chain, I promise you. 
Remove the quarrel from my father’s belly and make him ready for the silent sisters.” 
“As my queen commands.” Qyburn went to the bedside, paused, looked back. “And how shall I 
deal with the girl, Your Grace?” 
“Girl?” Cersei had overlooked the second body. She strode to the bed, flung aside the heap of 
bloody coverlets, and there she was, naked, cold, and pink... save for her face, which had turned 
as black as Joff’s had at his wedding feast. A chain of linked golden hands was half-buried in the 
flesh of her throat, twisted so tight that it had broken the skin. Cersei hissed like an angry cat. 
“What is she doing here?” 
“We found her there, Your Grace,” said Shortear. “It’s the Imp’s whore.” As if that explained 
why she was here. 
My lord father had no use for whores, she thought. After our mother died he never touched a 
woman. She gave the guardsman a chilly look. “This is not... when Lord Tywin’s father died he 
returned to Casterly Rock to find a... a woman of this sort... bedecked in his lady mother’s 
jewels, wearing one of her gowns. He stripped them off her, and all else as well. For a fortnight 
she was paraded naked through the streets of Lannisport, to confess to every man she met that 
she was a thief and a harlot. That was how Lord Tywin Lannister dealt with whores. He never... 
this woman was here for some other purpose, not for...” 
“Perhaps his lordship was questioning the girl about her mistress,” Qyburn suggested. “Sansa 
Stark vanished the night the king was murdered, I have heard.” 
“That’s so.” Cersei seized on the suggestion eagerly. “He was questioning her, to be sure. There 
can be no doubt.” She could see Tyrion leering, his mouth twisted into a monkey’s grin beneath 
the ruin of his nose. And what better way to question her than naked, with her legs well spread? 
the dwarf whispered. That’s how I like to question her too. 
The queen turned away. I will not look at her. Suddenly it was too much even to be in the same 
room as the dead woman. She pushed past Qyburn, out into the hall. 
Ser Osmund had been joined by his brothers Osney and Osfryd. “There is a dead woman in the 
Hand’s bedchamber,” Cersei told the three Kettleblacks. “No one is ever to know that she was 
here.” 
“Aye, m’lady.” Ser Osney had faint scratches on his cheek where another of Tyrion’s whores 
had clawed him. “And what shall we do with her?” 
“Feed her to your dogs. Keep her for a bedmate. What do I care? She was never here. I’ll have 
the tongue of any man who dares to say she was. Do you understand me?” 
Osney and Osfryd exchanged a look. “Aye, Your Grace.” 

She followed them back inside and watched as they bundled the girl up in her father’s bloody 
blankets. Shae, her name was Shae. They had last spoken the night before the dwarf’s trial by 
combat, after that smiling Dornish snake offered to champion him. Shae had been asking about 
some jewels Tyrion had given her, and certain promises Cersei might have made, a manse in the 
city and a knight to marry her. The queen made it plain that the whore would have nothing of her 
until she told them where Sansa Stark had gone. “You were her maid. Do you expect me to 
believe that you knew nothing of her plans?” she had said. Shae left in tears. 
Ser Osfryd slung the bundled corpse up over his shoulder. “I want that chain,” Cersei said. “See 
that you do not scratch the gold.” Osfryd nodded and started toward the door. “No, not through 
the yard.” She gestured toward the secret passage. “There’s a shaft down to the dungeons. That 
way.” 
As Ser Osfryd went down on one knee before the hearth, the light brightened within, and the 
queen heard noises. Jaime emerged bent over like an old woman, his boots kicking up puffs of 
soot from Lord Tywin’s last fire. “Get out of my way,” he told the Kettleblacks. 
Cersei rushed toward him. “Did you find them? Did you find the killers? How many were 
there?” Surely there had been more than one. One man alone could not have killed her father. 
Her twin’s face had a haggard look. “The shaft goes down to a chamber where half a dozen 
tunnels meet. They’re closed off by iron gates, chained and locked. I need to find keys.” He 
glanced around the bedchamber. “Whoever did this might still be lurking in the walls. It’s a maze 
back there, and dark.” 
She imagined Tyrion creeping between the walls like some monstrous rat. No. You are being 
silly. The dwarf is in his cell. “Take hammers to the walls. Knock this tower down, if you must. I 
want them found. Whoever did this. I want them killed.” 
Jaime hugged her, his good hand pressing against the small of her back. He smelled of ash, but 
the morning sun was in his hair, giving it a golden glow. She wanted to draw his face to hers for 
a kiss. Later, she told herself, later he will come to me, for comfort. “We are his heirs, Jaime,” 
she whispered. “It will be up to us to finish his work. You must take Father’s place as Hand. You 
see that now, surely. Tommen will need you...” 
He pushed away from her and raised his arm, forcing his stump into her face. “A Hand without 
a hand? A bad jape, sister. Don’t ask me to rule.” 
Their uncle heard the rebuff. Qyburn as well, and the Kettleblacks, wrestling their bundle 
through the ashes. Even the guardsmen heard, Puckens and Hoke the Horseleg and Shortear. It 
will be all over the castle by nightfall. Cersei felt the heat rising up her cheeks. “Rule? I said 
naught of ruling. I shall rule until my son comes of age.” 
“I don’t know who I pity more,” her brother said. “Tommen, or the Seven Kingdoms.” 
She slapped him. Jaime’s arm rose to catch the blow, cat-quick... but this cat had a cripple’s 
stump in place of a right hand. Her fingers left red marks on his cheek. 
The sound brought their uncle to his feet. “Your father lies here dead. Have the decency to take 
your quarrel outside.” 

Jaime inclined his head in apology. “Forgive us, Uncle. My sister is sick with grief. She forgets 
herself.” 
She wanted to slap him again for that. I must have been mad to think he could be Hand. She 
would sooner abolish the office. When had a Hand ever brought her anything but grief? Jon 
Arryn put Robert Baratheon in her bed, and before he died he’d begun sniffing about her and 
Jaime as well. Eddard Stark took up right where Arryn had left off; his meddling had forced her 
to rid herself of Robert sooner than she would have liked, before she could deal with his 
pestilential brothers. Tyrion sold Myrcella to the Dornishmen, made one of her sons his hostage, 
and murdered the other. And when Lord Tywin returned to King’s Landing... 
The next Hand will know his place, she promised herself. It would have to be Ser Kevan. Her 
uncle was tireless, prudent, unfailingly obedient. She could rely on him, as her father had. The 
hand does not argue with the head. She had a realm to rule, but she would need new men to help 
her rule it. Pycelle was a doddering lickspittle, Jaime had lost his courage with his sword hand, 
and Mace Tyrell and his cronies Redwyne and Rowan could not be trusted. For all she knew they 
might have had a part in this. Lord Tyrell had to know that he would never rule the Seven 
Kingdoms so long as Tywin Lannister lived. 
I will need to move carefully with that one. The city was full of his men, and he’d even 
managed to plant one of his sons in the Kingsguard, and meant to plant his daughter in 
Tommen’s bed. It still made her furious to think that Father had agreed to betroth Tommen to 
Margaery Tyrell. The girl is twice his age and twice widowed. Mace Tyrell claimed his daughter 
was still virgin, but Cersei had her doubts. Joffrey had been murdered before he could bed the 
girl, but she had been wed to Renly first... A man may prefer the taste of hippocras, yet if you set 
a tankard of ale before him, he will quaff it quick enough. She must command Lord Varys to find 
out what he could. 
That stopped her where she stood. She had forgotten about Varys. He should be here. He is 
always here. Whenever anything of import happened in the Red Keep, the eunuch appeared as if 
from nowhere. Jaime is here, and Uncle Kevan, and Pycelle has come and gone, but not Varys. A 
cold finger touched her spine. He was part of this. He must have feared that Father meant to have 
his head, so he struck first. Lord Tywin had never had any love for the simpering master of 
whisperers. And if any man knew the Red Keep’s secrets, it was surely the master of whisperers. 
He must have made common cause with Lord Stannis. They served together on Robert’s council, 
after all... 
Cersei strode to the door of the bedchamber, to Ser Meryn Trant. “Trant, bring me Lord Varys. 
Squealing and squirming if need be, but unharmed.” 
“As Your Grace commands.” 
But no sooner had one Kingsguard departed than another one returned. Ser Boros Blount was 
red-faced and puffing from his headlong rush up the steps. “Gone,” he panted, when he saw the 
queen. He sank to one knee. “The Imp... his cell’s open, Your Grace... no sign of him 
anywhere...” 

The dream was true. “I gave orders,” she said. “He was to be kept under guard, night and 
day...” 
Blount’s chest was heaving. “One of the gaolers has gone missing too. Rugen, his name was. 
Two other men we found asleep.” 
It was all she could do not to scream. “I hope you did not wake them, Ser Boros. Let them 
sleep.” 
“Sleep?” He looked up, jowly and confused. “Aye, Your Grace. How long shall—” 
“Forever. See that they sleep forever, ser. I will not suffer guards to sleep on watch.” He is in 
the walls. He killed Father as he killed Mother, as he killed Joff. The dwarf would come for her 
as well, the queen knew, just as the old woman had promised her in the dimness of that tent. I 
laughed in her face, but she had powers. I saw my future in a drop of blood. My doom. Her legs 
were weak as water. Ser Boros tried to take her by the arm, but the queen recoiled from his 
touch. For all she knew he might be one of Tyrion’s creatures. “Get away from me,” she said. 
“Get away!” She staggered to a settle. 
“Your Grace?” said Blount. “Shall I fetch a cup of water?” 
It is blood I need, not water. Tyrion’s blood, the blood of the valonqar. The torches spun around 
her. Cersei closed her eyes, and saw the dwarf grinning at her. No, she thought, no, I was almost 
rid of you. But his fingers had closed around her neck, and she could feel them beginning to 
tighten. 

BRIENNE 
“I am looking for a maid of three-and-ten,” she told the grey-haired goodwife beside the 
village well. “A highborn maid and very beautiful, with blue eyes and auburn hair. She may have 
been traveling with a portly knight of forty years, or perhaps with a fool. Have you seen her?” 
“Not as I recall, ser,” the goodwife said, knuckling her forehead. “But I’ll keep my eye out, that 
I will.” 
The blacksmith had not seen her either, nor the septon in the village sept, the swineherd with 
his pigs, the girl pulling up onions from her garden, nor any of the other simple folk that the 
Maid of Tarth found amongst the daub-and-wattle huts of Rosby. Still, she persisted. This is the 
shortest road to Duskendale, Brienne told herself. If Sansa came this way, someone must have 
seen her. At the castle gates she posed her question to two spearmen whose badges showed three 
red chevronels on ermine, the arms of House Rosby. “If she’s on the roads these days she won’t 
be no maid for long,” said the older man. The younger wanted to know if the girl had that auburn 
hair between her legs as well. 
I will find no help here. As Brienne mounted up again, she glimpsed a skinny boy atop a 
piebald horse at the far end of the village. I have not talked with that one, she thought, but he 
vanished behind the sept before she could seek him out. She did not trouble to chase after him. 
Most like he knew no more than the others had. Rosby was scarce more than a wide place in the 
road; Sansa would have had no reason to linger here. Returning to the road, Brienne headed 
north and east past apple orchards and fields of barley, and soon left the village and its castle 
well behind. It was at Duskendale that she would find her quarry, she told herself. If she came 
this way at all. 
“I will find the girl and keep her safe,” Brienne had promised Ser Jaime, back at King’s 
Landing. “For her lady mother’s sake. And for yours.” Noble words, but words were easy. Deeds 
were hard. She had lingered too long and learned too little in the city. I should have set out 
earlier... but to where? Sansa Stark had vanished on the night King Joffrey died, and if anyone 
had seen her since, or had any inkling where she might have gone, they were not talking. Not to 
me, at least. 
Brienne believed the girl had left the city. If she were still in King’s Landing, the gold cloaks 
would have turned her up. She had to have gone elsewhere... but elsewhere is a big place. If I 
were a maiden newly flowered, alone and afraid, in desperate danger, what would I do? she had 
asked herself. Where would I go? For her, the answer came easy. She would make her way back 
to Tarth, to her father. Sansa’s father had been beheaded whilst she watched, however. Her lady 
mother was dead too, murdered at the Twins, and Winterfell, the great Stark stronghold, had 
been sacked and burned, its people put to the sword. She has no home to run to, no father, no 
mother, no brothers. She might be in the next town, or on a ship to Asshai; one seemed as likely 
as the other. 
Even if Sansa Stark had wanted to go home, how would she get there? The kingsroad was not 
safe; even a child would know that. The ironborn held Moat Cailin athwart the Neck, and at the 

Twins sat the Freys, who had murdered Sansa’s brother and lady mother. The girl could go by 
sea if she had the coin, but the harbor at King’s Landing was still in ruins, the river a jumble of 
broken quays and burned and sunken galleys. Brienne had asked along the docks, but no one 
could remember a ship leaving on the night King Joffrey died. A few trading ships were 
anchoring in the bay and off-loading by boat, one man told her, but more were continuing up the 
coast to Duskendale, where the port was busier than ever. 
Brienne’s mare was sweet to look upon and kept a pretty pace. There were more travelers than 
she would have thought. Begging brothers trundled by with their bowls dangling on thongs about 
their necks. A young septon galloped past upon a palfrey as fine as any lord’s, and later she met 
a band of silent sisters who shook their heads when Brienne put her question to them. A train of 
oxcarts lumbered south with grain and sacks of wool, and later she passed a swineherd driving 
pigs, and an old woman in a horse litter with an escort of mounted guards. She asked all of them 
if they had seen a highborn girl of three-and-ten years with blue eyes and auburn hair. None had. 
She asked about the road ahead as well. “’Twixt here and Duskendale is safe enough,” one man 
told her, “but past Duskendale there’s outlaws, and broken men in the woods.” 
Only the soldier pines and sentinels still showed green; the broadleaf trees had donned mantles 
of russet and gold, or else uncloaked themselves to scratch against the sky with branches brown 
and bare. Every gust of wind drove swirling clouds of dead leaves across the rutted road. They 
made a rustling sound as they scuttled past the hooves of the big bay mare that Jaime Lannister 
had bestowed on her. As easy to find one leaf in the wind as one girl lost in Westeros. She found 
herself wondering whether Jaime had given her this task as some cruel jape. Perhaps Sansa Stark 
was dead, beheaded for her part in King Joffrey’s death, buried in some unmarked grave. How 
better to conceal her murder than by sending some big stupid wench from Tarth to find her? 
Jaime would not do that. He was sincere. He gave me the sword, and called it Oathkeeper. 
Anyway, it made no matter. She had promised Lady Catelyn that she would bring back her 
daughters, and no promise was as solemn as one sworn to the dead. The younger girl was long 
dead, Jaime claimed; the Arya the Lannisters sent north to marry Roose Bolton’s bastard was a 
fraud. That left only Sansa. Brienne had to find her. 
Near dusk she saw a campfire burning by a brook. Two men sat beside it grilling trout, their 
arms and armor stacked beneath a tree. One was old and one was somewhat younger, though far 
from young. The younger rose to greet her. He had a big belly straining at the laces of his spotted 
doeskin jerkin. A shaggy untrimmed beard covered his cheeks and chin, the color of old gold. 
“We have trout enough for three, ser,” he called out. 
It was not the first time Brienne had been mistaken for a man. She pulled off her greathelm, 
letting her hair spill free. It was yellow, the color of dirty straw, and near as brittle. Long and 
thin, it blew about her shoulders. “I thank you, ser.” 
The hedge knight squinted at her so earnestly that she realized he must be nearsighted. “A lady, 
is it? Armed and armored? Illy, gods be good, the size of her.” 
“I took her for a knight as well,” the older knight said, turning the trout. 

Had Brienne been a man, she would have been called big; for a woman, she was huge. Freakish 
was the word she had heard all her life. She was broad in the shoulder and broader in the hips. 
Her legs were long, her arms thick. Her chest was more muscle than bosom. Her hands were big, 
her feet enormous. And she was ugly besides, with a freckled, horsey face and teeth that seemed 
almost too big for her mouth. She did not need to be reminded of any of that. “Sers,” she said, 
“have you seen a maid of three-and-ten upon the road? She has blue eyes and auburn hair, and 
may have been in company with a portly red-faced man of forty years.” 
The nearsighted hedge knight scratched his head. “I recall no such maid. What sort of hair is 
auburn?” 
“Browny red,” said the older man. “No, we saw her not.” 
“We saw her not, m’lady,” the younger told her. “Come, dismount, the fish is almost done. Are 
you hungry?” 
She was, as it happened, but she was wary as well. Hedge knights had an unsavory reputation. 
“A hedge knight and a robber knight are two sides of the same sword,” it was said. These two do 
not look too dangerous. “Might I know your names, sers?” 
“I have the honor to be Ser Creighton Longbough, of whom the singers sing,” said the big-
bellied one. “You will have heard of my deeds on the Blackwater, mayhaps. My companion is 
Ser Illifer the Penniless.” 
If there was a song about Creighton Longbough, it was not one Brienne had heard. Their names 
meant no more to her than did their arms. Ser Creighton’s green shield showed only a brown 
chief, and a deep gouge made by some battle-axe. Ser Illifer bore gold and ermine gyronny, 
though everything about him suggested that painted gold and painted ermine were the only sorts 
he’d ever known. He was sixty if he was a day, his face pinched and narrow beneath the hood of 
a patched roughspun mantle. Mail-clad he went, but flecks of rust spotted the iron like freckles. 
Brienne stood a head taller than either of them, and was better mounted and better armed in the 
bargain. If I fear the likes of these, I had as well swap my longsword for a pair of knitting 
needles. 
“I thank you, good sers,” she said. “I will gladly share your trout.” Swinging down, Brienne 
unsaddled her mare and watered her before hobbling her to graze. She stacked her arms and 
shield and saddlebags beneath an elm. By then the trout was crisply done. Ser Creighton brought 
her a fish, and she sat cross-legged on the ground to eat it. 
“We are bound for Duskendale, m’lady,” Longbough told her, as he pulled apart his own trout 
with his fingers. “You would do well to ride with us. The roads are perilous.” 
Brienne could have told him more about the perils of the roads than he might have cared to 
know. “I thank you, ser, but I have no need of your protection.” 
“I insist. A true knight must defend the gentler sex.” 
She touched her sword hilt. “This will defend me, ser.” 
“A sword is only as good as the man who wields it.” 
“I wield it well enough.” 

“As you will. It would not be courteous to argue with a lady. We will see you safe to 
Duskendale. Three together may ride more safely than one alone.” 
We were three when we set out from Riverrun, yet Jaime lost his hand and Cleos Frey his life. 
“Your mounts could not keep up with mine.” Ser Creighton’s brown gelding was an old 
swaybacked creature with rheumy eyes, and Ser Illifer’s horse looked weedy and half-starved. 
“My steed served me well enough on the Blackwater,” Ser Creighton insisted. “Why, I did great 
carnage there and won a dozen ransoms. Was m’lady familiar with Ser Herbert Bolling? You 
shall never meet him now. I slew him where he stood. When swords clash, you shall ne’er find 
Ser Creighton Longbough to the rear.” 
His companion gave a dry chuckle. “Creigh, leave off. The likes o’ her has no need for the likes 
o’ us.” 
“The likes of me?” Brienne was uncertain what he meant. 
Ser Illifer crooked a bony finger at her shield. Though its paint was cracked and peeling, the 
device it bore showed plain: a black bat on a field divided bendwise, silver and gold. “You bear a 
liar’s shield, to which you have no right. My grandfather’s grandfather helped kill the last o’ 
Lothston. None since has dared to show that bat, black as the deeds of them that bore it.” 
The shield was the one Ser Jaime had taken from the armory at Harrenhal. Brienne had found it 
in the stables with her mare, along with much else; saddle and bridle, chainmail hauberk and 
visored greathelm, purses of gold and silver and a parchment more valuable than either. “I lost 
mine own shield,” she explained. 
“A true knight is the only shield a maiden needs,” declared Ser Creighton stoutly. 
Ser Illifer paid him no mind. “A barefoot man looks for a boot, a chilly man a cloak. But who 
would cloak themselves in shame? Lord Lucas bore that bat, the Pander, and Manfryd o’ the 
Black Hood, his son. Why wear such arms, I ask myself, unless your own sin is fouler still... and 
fresher.” He unsheathed his dagger, an ugly piece of cheap iron. “A woman freakish big and 
freakish strong who hides her own true colors. Creigh, behold the Maid o’ Tarth, who opened 
Renly’s royal throat for him.” 
“That is a lie.” Renly Baratheon had been more than a king to her. She had loved him since first 
he came to Tarth on his leisurely lord’s progress, to mark his coming of age. Her father 
welcomed him with a feast and commanded her to attend; elsewise she would have hidden in her 
room like some wounded beast. She had been no older than Sansa, more afraid of sniggers than 
of swords. They will know about the rose, she told Lord Selwyn, they will laugh at me. But the 
Evenstar would not relent. 
And Renly Baratheon had shown her every courtesy, as if she were a proper maid, and pretty. 
He even danced with her, and in his arms she’d felt graceful, and her feet had floated across the 
floor. Later others begged a dance of her, because of his example. From that day forth, she 
wanted only to be close to Lord Renly, to serve him and protect him. But in the end she failed 
him. Renly died in my arms, but I did not kill him, she thought, but these hedge knights would 
never understand. “I would have given my life for King Renly, and died happy,” she said. “I did 
no harm to him. I swear it by my sword.” 

“A knight swears by his sword,” Ser Creighton said. 
“Swear it by the Seven,” urged Ser Illifer the Penniless. 
“By the Seven, then. I did no harm to King Renly. I swear it by the Mother. May I never know 
her mercy if I lie. I swear it by the Father, and ask that he might judge me justly. I swear it by the 
Maiden and Crone, by the Smith and the Warrior. And I swear it by the Stranger, may he take me 
now if I am false.” 
“She swears well, for a maid,” Ser Creighton allowed. 
“Aye.” Ser Illifer the Penniless gave a shrug. “Well, if she’s lied, the gods will sort her out.” He 
slipped his dagger back away. “The first watch is yours.” 
As the hedge knights slept, Brienne paced restlessly around the little camp, listening to the 
crackle of the fire. I should ride on whilst I can. She did not know these men, yet she could not 
bring herself to leave them undefended. Even in the black of night, there were riders on the road, 
and noises in the woods that might or might not have been owls and prowling foxes. So Brienne 
paced, and kept her blade loose in its scabbard. 
Her watch was easy, all in all. It was after that was hard, when Ser Illifer woke and said he 
would relieve her. Brienne spread a blanket on the ground, and curled up to close her eyes. I will 
not sleep, she told herself, bone weary though she was. She had never slept easily in the presence 
of men. Even in Lord Renly’s camps, the risk of rape was always there. It was a lesson she had 
learned beneath the walls of Highgarden, and again when she and Jaime had fallen into the hands 
of the Brave Companions. 
The cold in the earth seeped through Brienne’s blankets to soak into her bones. Before long 
every muscle felt clenched and cramped, from her jaw down to her toes. She wondered whether 
Sansa Stark was cold as well, wherever she might be. Lady Catelyn had said that Sansa was a 
gentle soul who loved lemon cakes, silken gowns, and songs of chivalry, yet the girl had seen her 
father’s head lopped off and been forced to marry one of his killers afterward. If half the tales 
were true, the dwarf was the cruelest Lannister of all. If she did poison King Joffrey, the Imp 
surely forced her hand. She was alone and friendless at that court. In King’s Landing, Brienne 
had hunted down a certain Brella, who had been one of Sansa’s maids. The woman told her that 
there was little warmth between Sansa and the dwarf. Perhaps she had been fleeing him as well 
as Joffrey’s murder. 
Whatever dreams Brienne dreamed were gone when dawn awoke her. Her legs were stiff as 
wood from the cold ground, but no one had molested her, and her goods remained untouched. 
The hedge knights were up and about. Ser Illifer was cutting up a squirrel for breakfast, while 
Ser Creighton stood facing a tree, having himself a good long piss. Hedge knights, she thought, 
old and vain and plump and nearsighted, yet decent men for all that. It cheered her to know that 
there were still decent men in the world. 
They broke their fast on roast squirrel, acorn paste, and pickles, whilst Ser Creighton regaled 
her with his exploits on the Blackwater, where he had slain a dozen fearsome knights that she 
had never heard of. “Oh, it was a rare fight, m’lady,” he said, “a rare and bloody fray.” He 
allowed that Ser Illifer had fought nobly in the battle as well. Illifer himself said little. 

When time came to resume their journey, the knights fell in on either side of her, like guards 
protecting some great lady... though this lady dwarfed both of her protectors and was better 
armed and armored in the nonce. “Did anyone pass by during your watches?” Brienne asked 
them. 
“Such as a maid of three-and-ten, with auburn hair?” said Ser Illifer the Penniless. “No, my 
lady. No one.” 
“I had a few,” Ser Creighton put in. “Some farm boy on a piebald horse went by, and an hour 
later half a dozen men afoot with staves and scythes. They caught sight of our fire, and stopped 
for a long look at our horses, but I showed them a glimpse of my steel and told them to be along 
their way. Rough fellows, by the look o’ them, and desperate too, but ne’er so desperate as to 
trifle with Ser Creighton Longbough.” 
No, Brienne thought, not so desperate as that. She turned away to hide her smile. Thankfully, 
Ser Creighton was too intent on the tale of his epic battle with the Knight of the Red Chicken to 
make note of the maiden’s mirth. It felt good to have companions on the road, even such 
companions as these two. 
It was midday when Brienne heard chanting drifting through the bare brown trees. “What is that 
sound?” Ser Creighton asked. 
“Voices, raised in prayer.” Brienne knew the chant. They are beseeching the Warrior for 
protection, asking the Crone to light their way. 
Ser Illifer the Penniless bared his battered blade and reined in his horse to wait their coming. 
“They are close now.” 
The chanting filled the woods like pious thunder. And suddenly the source of the sound 
appeared in the road ahead. A group of begging brothers led the way, scruffy bearded men in 
roughspun robes, some barefoot and some in sandals. Behind them marched threescore ragged 
men, women, and children, a spotted sow, and several sheep. Several of the men had axes, and 
more had crude wooden clubs and cudgels. In their midst there rolled a two-wheeled wayn of 
grey and splintered wood, piled high with skulls and broken bits of bone. When they saw the 
hedge knights, the begging brothers halted, and the chanting died away. “Good knights,” one 
said, “the Mother loves you.” 
“And you, brother,” said Ser Illifer. “Who are you?” 
“Poor fellows,” said a big man with an axe. Despite the chill of the autumnal wood, he was 
shirtless, and on his breast was carved a seven-pointed star. Andal warriors had carved such stars 
in their flesh when first they crossed the narrow sea to overwhelm the kingdoms of the First 
Men. 
“We are marching to the city,” said a tall woman in the traces of the wayn, “to bring these holy 
bones to Blessed Baelor, and seek succor and protection from the king.” 
“Join us, friends,” urged a spare small man in a threadbare septon’s robe, who wore a crystal on 
a thong about his neck. “Westeros has need of every sword.” 
“We were bound for Duskendale,” declared Ser Creighton, “but mayhaps we could see you 
safely to King’s Landing.” 

“If you have the coin to pay us for this escort,” added Ser Illifer, who seemed practical as well 
as penniless. 
“Sparrows need no gold,” the septon said. 
Ser Creighton was lost. “Sparrows?” 
“The sparrow is the humblest and most common of birds, as we are the humblest and most 
common of men.” The septon had a lean sharp face and a short beard, grizzled grey and brown. 
His thin hair was pulled back and knotted behind his head, and his feet were bare and black, 
gnarled and hard as tree roots. “These are the bones of holy men, murdered for their faith. They 
served the Seven even unto death. Some starved, some were tortured. Septs have been despoiled, 
maidens and mothers raped by godless men and demon worshipers. Even silent sisters have been 
molested. Our Mother Above cries out in her anguish. It is time for all anointed knights to 
forsake their worldly masters and defend our Holy Faith. Come with us to the city, if you love 
the Seven.” 
“I love them well enough,” said Illifer, “yet I must eat.” 
“So must all the Mother’s children.” 
“We are bound for Duskendale,” Ser Illifer said flatly. 
One of the begging brothers spat, and a woman gave a moan. “You are false knights,” said the 
big man with the star carved on his chest. Several others brandished their cudgels. 
The barefoot septon calmed them with a word. “Judge not, for judgment is the Father’s. Let 
them pass in peace. They are poor fellows too, lost upon the earth.” 
Brienne edged her mare forward. “My sister is lost as well. A girl of three-and-ten with auburn 
hair, fair to look upon.” 
“All the Mother’s children are fair to look upon. May the Maiden watch over this poor girl... 
and you as well, I think.” The septon lifted one of the traces of the wayn upon his shoulder, and 
began to pull. The begging brothers took up the chant once more. Brienne and the hedge knights 
sat upon their horses as the procession moved slowly past, following the rutted road toward 
Rosby. The sound of their chanting slowly dwindled away and died. 
Ser Creighton lifted one cheek off the saddle to scratch his arse. “What sort of man would slay 
a holy septon?” 
Brienne knew what sort. Near Maidenpool, she recalled, the Brave Companions had strung a 
septon up by his heels from the limb of a tree and used his corpse for archery practice. She 
wondered if his bones were piled in that wayn with all the rest. 
“A man would need to be a fool to rape a silent sister,” Ser Creighton was saying. “Even to lay 
hands upon one... it’s said they are the Stranger’s wives, and their female parts are cold and wet 
as ice.” He glanced at Brienne. “Uh... beg pardon.” 
Brienne spurred her mare toward Duskendale. After a moment, Ser Illifer followed, and Ser 
Creighton came bringing up the rear. 
Three hours later they came up upon another party struggling toward Duskendale; a merchant 
and his serving men, accompanied by yet another hedge knight. The merchant rode a dappled 
grey mare, whilst his servants took turns pulling his wagon. Four labored in the traces as the 

other two walked beside the wheels, but when they heard the sound of horses they formed up 
around the wagon with quarterstaffs of ash at the ready. The merchant produced a crossbow, the 
knight a blade. “You will forgive me if I am suspicious,” called the merchant, “but the times are 
troubled, and I have only good Ser Shadrich to defend me. Who are you?” 
“Why,” Ser Creighton said, affronted, “I am the famous Ser Creighton Longbough, fresh from 
battle on the Blackwater, and this is my companion, Ser Illifer the Penniless.” 
“We mean you no harm,” said Brienne. 
The merchant considered her doubtfully. “My lady, you should be safe at home. Why do you 
wear such unnatural garb?” 
“I am searching for my sister.” She dared not mention Sansa’s name, with her accused of 
regicide. “She is a highborn maid and beautiful, with blue eyes and auburn hair. Perhaps you saw 
her with a portly knight of forty years, or a drunken fool.” 
“The roads are full of drunken fools and despoiled maidens. As to portly knights, it is hard for 
any honest man to keep his belly round when so many lack for food... though your Ser Creighton 
has not hungered, it would seem.” 
“I have big bones,” Ser Creighton insisted. “Shall we ride together for a time? I do not doubt 
Ser Shadrich’s valor, but he seems small, and three blades are better than one.” 
Four blades, thought Brienne, but she held her tongue. 
The merchant looked to his escort. “What say you, ser?” 
“Oh, these three are nought to fear.” Ser Shadrich was a wiry, fox-faced man with a sharp nose 
and a shock of orange hair, mounted on a rangy chestnut courser. Though he could not have been 
more than five foot two, he had a cocksure manner. “The one is old, t’other fat, and the big one is 
a woman. Let them come.” 
“As you say.” The merchant lowered his crossbow. 
As they resumed their journey, the hired knight dropped back and looked her up and down as if 
she were a side of good salt pork. “You’re a strapping healthy wench, I’d say.” 
Ser Jaime’s mockery had cut her deep; the little man’s words hardly touched her. “A giant, 
compared to some.” 
He laughed. “I am big enough where it counts, wench.” 
“The merchant called you Shadrich.” 
“Ser Shadrich of the Shady Glen. Some call me the Mad Mouse.” He turned his shield to show 
her his sigil, a large white mouse with fierce red eyes, on bendy brown and blue. “The brown is 
for the lands I’ve roamed, the blue for the rivers that I’ve crossed. The mouse is me.” 
“And are you mad?” 
“Oh, quite. Your common mouse will run from blood and battle. The mad mouse seeks them 
out.” 
“It would seem he seldom finds them.” 
“I find enough. ’Tis true, I am no tourney knight. I save my valor for the battlefield, woman.” 
Woman was marginally better than wench, she supposed. “You and good Ser Creighton have 
much in common, then.” 

Ser Shadrich laughed. “Oh, I doubt that, but it may be that you and I share a quest. A little lost 
sister, is it? With blue eyes and auburn hair?” He laughed again. “You are not the only hunter in 
the woods. I seek for Sansa Stark as well.” 
Brienne kept her face a mask, to hide her dismay. “Who is this Sansa Stark, and why do you 
seek her?” 
“For love, why else?” 
She furrowed her brow. “Love?” 
“Aye, love of gold. Unlike your good Ser Creighton, I did fight upon the Blackwater, but on the 
losing side. My ransom ruined me. You know who Varys is, I trust? The eunuch has offered a 
plump bag of gold for this girl you’ve never heard of. I am not a greedy man. If some oversized 
wench would help me find this naughty child, I would split the Spider’s coin with her.” 
“I thought you were in this merchant’s hire.” 
“Only so far as Duskendale. Hibald is as niggardly as he is fearful. And he is very fearful. What 
say you, wench?” 
“I know no Sansa Stark,” she insisted. “I am searching for my sister, a highborn girl...” 
“... with blue eyes and auburn hair, aye. Pray, who is this knight who travels with your sister? 
Or did you name him fool?” Ser Shadrich did not wait for her answer, which was good, since she 
had none. “A certain fool vanished from King’s Landing the night King Joffrey died, a stout 
fellow with a nose full of broken veins, one Ser Dontos the Red, formerly of Duskendale. I pray 
your sister and her drunken fool are not mistaken for the Stark girl and Ser Dontos. That could be 
most unfortunate.” He put his heels into his courser and trotted on ahead. 
Even Jaime Lannister had seldom made Brienne feel such a fool. You are not the only hunter in 
the woods. The woman Brella had told her how Joffrey had stripped Ser Dontos of his spurs, 
how Lady Sansa begged Joffrey for his life. He helped her flee, Brienne had decided, when she 
heard the tale. Find Ser Dontos, and I will find Sansa. She should have known there would be 
others who would see it too. Some may even be less savory than Ser Shadrich. She could only 
hope that Ser Dontos had hidden Sansa well. But if so, how will I ever find her? 
She hunched her shoulders down and rode on, frowning. 
Night was gathering by the time their party came upon the inn, a tall, timbered building that 
stood beside a river junction, astride an old stone bridge. That was the inn’s name, Ser Creighton 
told them: the Old Stone Bridge. The innkeep was a friend of his. “Not a bad cook, and the 
rooms have no more fleas than most,” he vouched. “Who’s for a warm bed tonight?” 
“Not us, unless your friend is giving them away,” said Ser Illifer the Penniless. “We have no 
coin for rooms.” 
“I can pay for the three of us.” Brienne did not lack for coin; Jaime had seen to that. In her 
saddlebags she’d found a purse fat with silver stags and copper stars, a smaller one stuffed with 
golden dragons, and a parchment commanding all loyal subjects of the king to assist the bearer, 
Brienne of House Tarth, who was about His Grace’s business. It was signed in a childish hand by 
Tommen, the First of His Name, King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men, and Lord 
of the Seven Kingdoms. 

Hibald was for stopping too, and bid his men to leave the wagon near the stables. Warm yellow 
light shone through the diamond-shaped panes of the inn’s windows, and Brienne heard a 
stallion trumpet at the scent of her mare. She was loosening the saddle when a boy came out the 
stable door, and said, “Let me do that, ser.” 
“I am no ser,” she told him, “but you may take the horse. See that she is fed and brushed and 
watered.” 
The boy reddened. “Beg pardons, m’lady. I thought...” 
“It is a common mistake.” Brienne gave him the reins and followed the others into the inn, with 
her saddlebags across a shoulder and her bedroll tucked up beneath one arm. 
Sawdust covered the plank floor of the common room, and the air smelled of hops and smoke 
and meat. A roast was spitting and crackling over the fire, unattended for the moment. Six locals 
sat about a table, talking, but they broke off when the strangers entered. Brienne could feel their 
eyes. Despite chainmail, cloak, and jerkin, she felt naked. When one man said, “Have a look at 
that,” she knew he was not speaking of Ser Shadrich. 
The innkeep appeared, clutching three tankards in each hand and slopping ale at every step. 
“Do you have rooms, good man?” the merchant asked him. 
“I might,” the innkeep said, “for them as has coin.” 
Ser Creighton Longbough looked offended. “Naggle, is that how you would greet an old friend? 
’Tis me, Longbough.” 
“’Tis you indeed. You owe me seven stags. Show me some silver and I’ll show you a bed.” The 
innkeep set the tankards down one by one, slopping more ale on the table in the process. 
“I will pay for one room for myself, and a second for my two companions.” Brienne indicated 
Ser Creighton and Ser Illifer. 
“I shall take a room as well,” said the merchant, “for myself and good Ser Shadrich. My serving 
men will bed down in your stables, if it please you.” 
The innkeep looked them over. “It don’t please me, but might be I’ll allow it. Will you be 
wanting supper? That’s good goat on the spit, that is.” 
“I shall judge its goodness for myself,” Hibald announced. “My men will content themselves 
with bread and drippings.” 
And so they supped. Brienne tried the goat herself, after following the innkeep up the steps, 
pressing some coins into his hand, and stashing her goods in the second room he showed her. 
She ordered goat for Ser Creighton and Ser Illifer as well, since they had shared their trout with 
her. The hedge knights and the septon washed down the meat with ale, but Brienne drank a cup 
of goat’s milk. She listened to the table talk, hoping against hope that she might hear something 
that would help her find Sansa. 
“You come from King’s Landing,” one of the locals said to Hibald. “Is it true that the 
Kingslayer’s been crippled?” 
“True enough,” Hibald said. “He’s lost his sword hand.” 
“Aye,” Ser Creighton said, “chewed off by a direwolf, I hear, one of them monsters come down 
from the north. Nought that’s good ever come from the north. Even their gods are queer.” 

“It was not a wolf,” Brienne heard herself say. “Ser Jaime lost his hand to a Qohorik 
sellsword.” 
“It is no easy thing to fight with your off hand,” observed the Mad Mouse. 
“Bah,” said Ser Creighton Longbough. “As it happens, I fight as well with either hand.” 
“Oh, I have no doubt of that.” Ser Shadrich lifted his tankard in salute. 
Brienne remembered her fight with Jaime Lannister in the woods. It had been all that she could 
do to keep his blade at bay. He was weak from his imprisonment, and chained at the wrists. No 
knight in the Seven Kingdoms could have stood against him at his full strength, with no chains to 
hamper him. Jaime had done many wicked things, but the man could fight! His maiming had 
been monstrously cruel. It was one thing to slay a lion, another to hack his paw off and leave him 
broken and bewildered. 
Suddenly the common room was too loud to endure a moment longer. She muttered her good-
nights and took herself up to bed. The ceiling in her room was low; entering with a taper in her 
hand, Brienne had to duck or crack her head. The only furnishings were a bed wide enough to 
sleep six, and the stub of a tallow candle on the sill. She lit it with the taper, barred the door, and 
hung her sword belt from a bedpost. Her scabbard was a plain thing, wood wrapped in cracked 
brown leather, and her sword was plainer still. She had bought it in King’s Landing, to replace 
the blade the Brave Companions had stolen. Renly’s sword. It still hurt, knowing she had lost it. 
But she had another longsword hidden in her bedroll. She sat on the bed and took it out. Gold 
glimmered yellow in the candlelight and rubies smoldered red. When she slid Oathkeeper from 
the ornate scabbard, Brienne’s breath caught in her throat. Black and red the ripples ran, deep 
within the steel. Valyrian steel, spell-forged. It was a sword fit for a hero. When she was small, 
her nurse had filled her ears with tales of valor, regaling her with the noble exploits of Ser 
Galladon of Morne, Florian the Fool, Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, and other champions. 
Each man bore a famous sword, and surely Oathkeeper belonged in their company, even if she 
herself did not. “You’ll be defending Ned Stark’s daughter with Ned Stark’s own steel,” Jaime 
had promised. 
Kneeling between the bed and wall, she held the blade and said a silent prayer to the Crone, 
whose golden lamp showed men the way through life. Lead me, she prayed, light the way before 
me, show me the path that leads to Sansa. She had failed Renly, had failed Lady Catelyn. She 
must not fail Jaime. He trusted me with his sword. He trusted me with his honor. 
Afterward she stretched out on the bed as best she could. For all its width it was not long 
enough, so Brienne lay across it sideways. She could hear the clatter of tankards from below, and 
voices drifting up the steps. The fleas that Longbough had spoken of put in their appearance. 
Scratching helped keep her awake. 
She heard Hibald mount the stairs, and sometime later the knights as well. “... I never knew his 
name,” Ser Creighton was saying as he went by, “but upon his shield he bore a blood-red 
chicken, and his blade was dripping gore...” His voice faded, and somewhere up above, a door 
opened and closed. 

Her candle burned out. Darkness settled over the Old Stone Bridge, and the inn grew so still 
that she could hear the murmur of the river. Only then did Brienne rise to gather up her things. 
She eased the door open, listened, made her way barefoot down the steps. Outside she donned 
her boots and hurried to the stables to saddle her bay mare, asking a silent pardon of Ser 
Creighton and Ser Illifer as she mounted. One of Hibald’s serving men woke when she rode past 
him, but made no move to stop her. Her mare’s hooves rang upon the old stone bridge. Then the 
trees closed in around her, black as pitch and full of ghosts and memories. I am coming for you, 
Lady Sansa, she thought as she rode into the darkness. Be not afraid. I shall not rest until I’ve 
found you. 

SAMWELL 
Sam was reading about the Others when he saw the mouse. 
His eyes were red and raw. I ought not rub them so much, he always told himself as he rubbed 
them. The dust made them itch and water, and the dust was everywhere down here. Little puffs 
of it filled the air every time a page was turned, and it rose in grey clouds whenever he shifted a 
stack of books to see what might be hiding on the bottom. 
Sam did not know how long it had been since last he’d slept, but scarce an inch remained of the 
fat tallow candle he’d lit when starting on the ragged bundle of loose pages that he’d found tied 
up in twine. He was beastly tired, but it was hard to stop. One more book, he had told himself, 
then I’ll stop. One more folio, just one more. One more page, then I’ll go up and rest and get a 
bite to eat. But there was always another page after that one, and another after that, and another 
book waiting underneath the pile. I’ll just take a quick peek to see what this one is about, he’d 
think, and before he knew he would be halfway through it. He had not eaten since that bowl of 
bean-and-bacon soup with Pyp and Grenn. Well, except for the bread and cheese, but that was 
only a nibble, he thought. That was when he took a quick glance at the empty platter, and spied 
the mouse feasting on the bread crumbs. 
The mouse was half as long as his pinky finger, with black eyes and soft grey fur. Sam knew he 
ought to kill it. Mice might prefer bread and cheese, but they ate paper too. He had found plenty 
of mouse droppings amongst the shelves and stacks, and some of the leather covers on the books 
showed signs of being gnawed. 
It is such a little thing, though. And hungry. How could he begrudge it a few crumbs? It’s 
eating books, though... 
After hours in the chair Sam’s back was stiff as a board, and his legs were half-asleep. He knew 
he was not quick enough to catch the mouse, but it might be he could squash it. By his elbow 
rested a massive leather-bound copy of Annals of the Black Centaur, Septon Jorquen’s 
exhaustively detailed account of the nine years that Orbert Caswell had served as Lord 
Commander of the Night’s Watch. There was a page for each day of his term, every one of 
which seemed to begin, “Lord Orbert rose at dawn and moved his bowels,” except for the last, 
which said, “Lord Orbert was found to have died during the night.” 
No mouse is a match for Septon Jorquen. Very slowly, Sam took hold of the book with his left 
hand. It was thick and heavy, and when he tried to lift it one-handed, it slipped from his plump 
fingers and thumped back down. The mouse was gone in half a heartbeat, skittery-quick. Sam 
was relieved. Squishing the poor little thing would have given him nightmares. “You shouldn’t 
eat the books, though,” he said aloud. Maybe he should bring more cheese the next time he came 
down here. 
He was surprised at how low the candle had burned. Had the bean-and-bacon soup been today 
or yesterday? Yesterday. It must have been yesterday. The realization made him yawn. Jon 
would be wondering what had become of him, though Maester Aemon would no doubt 
understand. Before he had lost his sight, the maester had loved books as much as Samwell Tarly 

did. He understood the way that you could sometimes fall right into them, as if each page was a 
hole into another world. 
Pushing himself to his feet, Sam grimaced at the pins and needles in his calves. The chair was 
very hard and cut into the back of his thighs when he bent over a book. I need to remember to 
bring a cushion. It would be even better if he could sleep down here, in the cell he’d found half-
hidden behind four chests full of loose pages that had gotten separated from the books they 
belonged to, but he did not want to leave Maester Aemon alone for so long. He had not been 
strong of late and required help, especially with the ravens. Aemon had Clydas, to be sure, but 
Sam was younger, and better with the birds. 
With a stack of books and scrolls under his left arm and the candle in his right hand, Sam made 
his way through the tunnels the brothers called the wormways. A pale shaft of light illuminated 
the steep stone steps that led up to the surface, so he knew that day had come up top. He left the 
candle burning in a wall niche and began the climb. By the fifth step he was puffing. At the tenth 
he stopped to shift the books to his right arm. 
He emerged beneath a sky the color of white lead. A snow sky, Sam thought, squinting up. The 
prospect made him uneasy. He remembered that night on the Fist of the First Men when the 
wights and the snows had come together. Don’t be so craven, he thought. You have your Sworn 
Brothers all around you, not to mention Stannis Baratheon and all his knights. Castle Black’s 
keeps and towers rose about him, dwarfed by the icy immensity of the Wall. A small army was 
crawling over the ice a quarter of the way up, where a new switchback stair was creeping upward 
to meet the remnants of the old one. The sounds of their saws and hammers echoed off the ice. 
Jon had the builders working night and day on the task. Sam had heard some of them 
complaining about it over supper, insisting that Lord Mormont never worked them half so hard. 
Without the great stair there was no way to reach the top of the Wall except by the chain winch, 
however. And as much as Samwell Tarly hated steps, he hated the winch cage more. He always 
closed his eyes when he was riding it, convinced that the chain was about to break. Every time 
the iron cage scraped against the ice his heart stopped beating for an instant. 
There were dragons here two hundred years ago, Sam found himself thinking, as he watched 
the cage making a slow descent. They would just have flown to the top of the Wall. Queen 
Alysanne had visited Castle Black on her dragon, and Jaehaerys, her king, had come after her on 
his own. Could Silverwing have left an egg behind? Or had Stannis found one egg on 
Dragonstone? Even if he has an egg, how can he hope to quicken it? Baelor the Blessed had 
prayed over his eggs, and other Targaryens had sought to hatch theirs with sorcery. All they got 
for it was farce and tragedy. 
“Samwell,” said a glum voice, “I was coming to fetch you. I was told to bring you to the Lord 
Commander.” 
A snowflake landed on Sam’s nose. “Jon wants to see me?” 
“As to that, I could not say,” said Dolorous Edd Tollett. “I never wanted to see half the things 
I’ve seen, and I’ve never seen half the things I wanted to. I don’t think wanting comes into it. 

You’d best go all the same. Lord Snow wishes to speak with you as soon as he is done with 
Craster’s wife.” 
“Gilly.” 
“That’s the one. If my wet nurse had looked like her, I’d still be on the teat. Mine had 
whiskers.” 
“Most goats do,” called Pyp, as he and Grenn emerged from around the corner, with longbows 
in hand and quivers of arrows on their backs. “Where have you been, Slayer? We missed you last 
night at supper. A whole roast ox went uneaten.” 
“Don’t call me Slayer.” Sam ignored the gibe about the ox. That was just Pyp. “I was reading. 
There was a mouse...” 
“Don’t mention mice to Grenn. He’s terrified of mice.” 
“I am not,” Grenn declared with indignation. 
“You’d be too scared to eat one.” 
“I’d eat more mice than you would.” 
Dolorous Edd Tollett gave a sigh. “When I was a lad, we only ate mice on special feast days. I 
was the youngest, so I always got the tail. There’s no meat on the tail.” 
“Where's your longbow, Sam?” asked Grenn. Ser Alliser used to call him Aurochs, and every 
day he seemed to grow into the name a little more. He had come to the Wall big but slow, thick 
of neck, thick of waist, red of face, and clumsy. Though his neck still reddened when Pyp twisted 
him around into some folly, hours of work with sword and shield had flattened his belly, 
hardened his arms, broadened his chest. He was strong, and shaggy as an aurochs too. “Ulmer 
was expecting you at the butts.” 
“Ulmer,” Sam said, abashed. Almost the first thing Jon Snow had done as Lord Commander 
was institute daily archery drill for the entire garrison, even stewards and cooks. The Watch had 
been placing too much emphasis on the sword and too little on the bow, he had said, a relic of the 
days when one brother in every ten had been a knight, instead of one in every hundred. Sam saw 
the sense in the decree, but he hated longbow practice almost as much as he hated climbing 
steps. When he wore his gloves he could never hit anything, but when he took them off he got 
blisters on his fingers. Those bows were dangerous. Satin had torn off half his thumbnail on a 
bowstring. “I forgot.” 
“You broke the heart of the wildling princess, Slayer,” said Pyp. Of late, Val had taken to 
watching them from the window of her chamber in the King’s Tower. “She was looking for 
you.” 
“She was not! Don’t say that!” Sam had only spoken to Val twice, when Maester Aemon called 
upon her to make sure the babes were healthy. The princess was so pretty that he oft found 
himself stammering and blushing in her presence. 
“Why not?” asked Pyp. “She wants to have your children. Maybe we should call you Sam the 
Seducer.” 

Sam reddened. King Stannis had plans for Val, he knew; she was the mortar with which he 
meant to seal the peace between the northmen and the free folk. “I don’t have time for archery 
today, I need to go see Jon.” 
“Jon? Jon? Do we know anyone named Jon, Grenn?” 
“He means the Lord Commander.” 
“Ohhh. The Great Lord Snow. To be sure. Why do you want to see him? He can’t even wiggle 
his ears.” Pyp wiggled his, to show he could. They were large ears, and red from cold. “He’s 
Lord Snow for true now, too bloody highborn for the likes of us.” 
“Jon has duties,” Sam said in his defense. “The Wall is his, and all that goes with it.” 
“A man has duties to his friends as well. If not for us, Janos Slynt might be our lord 
commander. Lord Janos would have sent Snow ranging naked on a mule. ‘Scamper on up to 
Craster’s Keep,’ he would have said, ‘and fetch me back the Old Bear’s cloak and boots.’ We 
saved him from that, but now he has too many duties to drink a cup of mulled wine by the fire?” 
Grenn agreed. “His duties don’t keep him from the yard. More days than not, he’s out there 
fighting someone.” 
That was true, Sam had to admit. Once, when Jon came to consult with Maester Aemon, Sam 
had asked him why he spent so much time at swordplay. “The Old Bear never trained much 
when he was Lord Commander,” he had pointed out. In answer, Jon had pressed Longclaw into 
Sam’s hand. He let him feel the lightness, the balance, had him turn the blade so that ripples 
gleamed in the smoke-dark metal. “Valyrian steel,” he said, “spell-forged and razor-sharp, nigh 
on indestructible. A swordsman should be as good as his sword, Sam. Longclaw is Valyrian 
steel, but I’m not. The Halfhand could have killed me as easy as you swat a bug.” 
Sam handed back the sword. “When I try to swat a bug, it always flies away. All I do is slap my 
arm. It stings.” 
That made Jon laugh. “As you will. Qhorin could have killed me as easy as you eat a bowl of 
porridge.” Sam was fond of porridge, especially when it was sweetened with honey. 
“I don’t have time for this.” Sam left his friends and made his way toward the armory, clutching 
his books to his chest. I am the shield that guards the realms of men, he remembered. He 
wondered what those men would say if they realized their realms were being guarded by the 
likes of Grenn, Pyp, and Dolorous Edd. 
The Lord Commander’s Tower had been gutted by fire, and Stannis Baratheon had claimed the 
King’s Tower for his own residence, so Jon Snow had established himself in Donal Noye’s 
modest quarters behind the armory. Gilly was leaving as Sam arrived, wrapped up in the old 
cloak he’d given her when they were fleeing Craster’s Keep. She almost rushed right past him, 
but Sam caught her arm, spilling two books as he did. “Gilly.” 
“Sam.” Her voice sounded raw. Gilly was dark-haired and slim, with the big brown eyes of a 
doe. She was swallowed by the folds of Sam’s old cloak, her face half-hidden by its hood, but 
shivering all the same. Her face looked wan and frightened. 
“What’s wrong?” Sam asked her. “How are the babes?” 
Gilly pulled loose from him. “They’re good, Sam. Good.” 

“Between the two of them it’s a wonder you can sleep,” Sam said pleasantly. “Which one was it 
that I heard crying last night? I thought he’d never stop.” 
“Dalla’s boy. He cries when he wants the teat. Mine... mine hardly ever cries. Sometimes he 
gurgles, but...” Her eyes filled with tears. “I have to go. It’s past time that I fed them. I’ll be 
leaking all over myself if I don’t go.” She rushed across the yard, leaving Sam perplexed behind 
her. 
He had to get down on his knees to gather up the books he’d dropped. I should not have brought 
so many, he told himself as he brushed the dirt off Colloquo Votar’s Jade Compendium, a thick 
volume of tales and legends from the east that Maester Aemon had commanded him to find. The 
book appeared undamaged. Maester Thomax’s Dragonkin, Being a History of House Targaryen 
from Exile to Apotheosis, with a Consideration of the Life and Death of Dragons had not been so 
fortunate. It had come open as it fell, and a few pages had gotten muddy, including one with a 
rather nice picture of Balerion the Black Dread done in colored inks. Sam cursed himself for a 
clumsy oaf as he smoothed the pages down and brushed them off. Gilly’s presence always 
flustered him and gave rise to... well, risings. A Sworn Brother of the Night’s Watch should not 
be feeling the sorts of things that Gilly made him feel, especially when she would talk about her 
breasts and... 
“Lord Snow is waiting.” Two guards in black cloaks and iron halfhelms stood by the doors of 
the armory, leaning on their spears. Hairy Hal was the one who’d spoken. Mully helped Sam 
back to his feet. He blurted out thanks and hurried past them, clutching desperately at the stack 
of books as he made his way past the forge with its anvil and bellows. A shirt of ringmail rested 
on his workbench, half-completed. Ghost was stretched out beneath the anvil, gnawing on the 
bone of an ox to get at the marrow. The big white direwolf looked up when Sam went by, but 
made no sound. 
Jon’s solar was back beyond the racks of spears and shields. He was reading a parchment when 
Sam entered. Lord Commander Mormont’s raven was on his shoulder, peering down as if it were 
reading too, but when the bird spied Sam it spread its wings and flapped toward him crying, 
“Corn, corn!” 
Shifting the books, Sam thrust his arm into the sack beside the door and came out with a 
handful of kernels. The raven landed on his wrist and took one from his palm, pecking so hard 
that Sam yelped and snatched his hand back. The raven took to the air again, and yellow and red 
kernels went everywhere. 
“Close the door, Sam.” Faint scars still marked Jon’s cheek, where an eagle had once tried to 
rip his eye out. “Did that wretch break the skin?” 
Sam eased the books down and peeled off his glove. “He did.” He felt faint. “I’m bleeding.” 
“We all shed our blood for the Watch. Wear thicker gloves.” Jon shoved a chair toward him 
with a foot. “Sit, and have a look at this.” He handed him the parchment. 
“What is it?” asked Sam. The raven began to hunt out corn kernels amongst the rushes. 
“A paper shield.” 

Sam sucked at the blood on his palm as he read. He knew Maester Aemon’s hand on sight. His 
writing was small and precise, but the old man could not see where the ink had blotted, and 
sometimes he left unsightly smears. “A letter to King Tommen?” 
“At Winterfell Tommen fought my brother Bran with wooden swords. He wore so much 
padding he looked like a stuffed goose. Bran knocked him to the ground.” Jon went to the 
window. “Yet Bran’s dead, and pudgy pink-faced Tommen is sitting on the Iron Throne, with a 
crown nestled amongst his golden curls.” 
Bran’s not dead, Sam wanted to say. He’s gone beyond the Wall with Coldhands. The words 
caught in his throat. I swore I would not tell. “You haven’t signed the letter.” 
“The Old Bear begged the Iron Throne for help a hundred times. They sent him Janos Slynt. No 
letter will make the Lannisters love us better. Not once they hear that we’ve been helping 
Stannis.” 
“Only to defend the Wall, not in his rebellion.” Sam read the letter quickly once again. “That’s 
what it says here.” 
“The distinction may escape Lord Tywin.” Jon took the letter back. “Why would he help us 
now? He never did before.” 
“Well,” said Sam, “he will not want it said that Stannis rode to the defense of the realm whilst 
King Tommen was playing with his toys. That would bring scorn down upon House Lannister.” 
“It’s death and destruction I want to bring down upon House Lannister, not scorn.” Jon lifted up 
the letter. “The Night’s Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms,” he read. “Our 
oaths are sworn to the realm, and the realm now stands in dire peril. Stannis Baratheon aids us 
against our foes from beyond the Wall, though we are not his men...” 
“Well,” said Sam, squirming, “we’re not. Are we?” 
“I gave Stannis food, shelter, and the Nightfort, plus leave to settle some free folk in the Gift. 
That’s all.” 
“Lord Tywin will say it was too much.” 
“Stannis says it’s not enough. The more you give a king the more he wants. We are walking on 
a bridge of ice with an abyss on either side. Pleasing one king is difficult enough. Pleasing two is 
hardly possible.” 
“Yes, but... if the Lannisters should prevail and Lord Tywin decides that we betrayed the king 
by aiding Stannis, it could mean the end of the Night’s Watch. He has the Tyrells behind him, 
with all the strength of Highgarden. And he did defeat Lord Stannis on the Blackwater.” The 
sight of blood might make Sam faint, but he knew how wars were won. His own father had seen 
to that. 
“The Blackwater was one battle. Robb won all his battles and still lost his head. If Stannis can 
raise the north...” 
He’s trying to convince himself, Sam realized, but he can’t. The ravens had gone forth from 
Castle Black in a storm of black wings, summoning the lords of the north to declare for Stannis 
Baratheon and join their strength to his. Sam had sent out most of them himself. Thusfar only 
one bird had returned, the one they’d sent to Karhold. Elsewise the silence had been thunderous. 

Even if he should somehow win the northmen to his side, Sam did not see how Stannis could 
hope to match the combined powers of Casterly Rock, Highgarden, and the Twins. Yet without 
the north, his cause was surely doomed. As doomed as the Night’s Watch, if Lord Tywin marks 
us down as traitors. “The Lannisters have northmen of their own. Lord Bolton and his bastard.” 
“Stannis has the Karstarks. If he can win White Harbor...” 
“If,” Sam stressed. “If not... my lord, even a paper shield is better than none.” 
Jon rattled the letter. “I suppose so.” He sighed, then took up a quill and scrawled a signature 
across the bottom of the letter. “Get the sealing wax.” Sam heated a stick of black wax over a 
candle and dribbled some onto the parchment, then watched as Jon pressed the Lord 
Commander’s seal down firmly on the puddle. “Take this to Maester Aemon when you leave,” 
he commanded, “and tell him to dispatch a bird to King’s Landing.” 
“I will.” Sam hesitated. “My lord, if I might ask... I saw Gilly leaving. She was almost crying.” 
“Val sent her to plead for Mance again.” 
“Oh.” Val was the sister of the woman the King-beyond-the-Wall had taken for his queen. The 
wildling princess was what Stannis and his men were calling her. Her sister Dalla had died 
during the battle, though no blade had ever touched her; she had perished giving birth to Mance 
Rayder’s son. Rayder himself would soon follow her to the grave, if the whispers Sam had heard 
had any truth to them. “What did you tell her?” 
“That I would speak to Stannis, though I doubt my words will sway him. A king’s first duty is 
to defend the realm, and Mance attacked it. His Grace is not like to forget that. My father used to 
say that Stannis Baratheon was a just man. No one has ever said he was forgiving.” Jon paused, 
frowning. “I would sooner take off Mance’s head myself. He was a man of the Night’s Watch, 
once. By rights, his life belongs to us.” 
“Pyp says that Lady Melisandre means to give him to the flames, to work some sorcery.” 
“Pyp should learn to hold his tongue. I have heard the same from others. King’s blood, to wake 
a dragon. Where Melisandre thinks to find a sleeping dragon, no one is quite sure. It’s nonsense. 
Mance’s blood is no more royal than mine own. He has never worn a crown nor sat a throne. 
He’s a brigand, nothing more. There’s no power in brigand’s blood.” 
The raven looked up from the floor. “Blood,” it screamed. 
Jon paid no mind. “I am sending Gilly away.” 
“Oh.” Sam bobbed his head. “Well, that’s... that’s good, my lord.” It would be the best thing for 
her, to go somewhere warm and safe, well away from the Wall and the fighting. 
“Her and the boy. We will need to find another wet nurse for his milk brother.” 
“Goat’s milk might serve, until you do. It’s better for a babe than cow’s milk.” Sam had read 
that somewhere. He shifted in his seat. “My lord, when I was looking through the annals I came 
on another boy commander. Four hundred years before the Conquest. Osric Stark was ten when 
he was chosen, but he served for sixty years. That’s four, my lord. You’re not even close to being 
the youngest ever chosen. You’re fifth youngest, so far.” 
“The younger four all being sons, brothers, or bastards of the King in the North. Tell me 
something useful. Tell me of our enemy.” 

“The Others.” Sam licked his lips. “They are mentioned in the annals, though not as often as I 
would have thought. The annals I’ve found and looked at, that is. There’s more I haven’t found, I 
know. Some of the older books are falling to pieces. The pages crumble when I try and turn 
them. And the really old books... either they have crumbled all away or they are buried 
somewhere that I haven’t looked yet or... well, it could be that there are no such books, and never 
were. The oldest histories we have were written after the Andals came to Westeros. The First 
Men only left us runes on rocks, so everything we think we know about the Age of Heroes and 
the Dawn Age and the Long Night comes from accounts set down by septons thousands of years 
later. There are archmaesters at the Citadel who question all of it. Those old histories are full of 
kings who reigned for hundreds of years, and knights riding around a thousand years before there 
were knights. You know the tales, Brandon the Builder, Symeon Star-Eyes, Night’s King... we 
say that you’re the nine hundred and ninety-eighth Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch, but 
the oldest list I’ve found shows six hundred seventy-four commanders, which suggests that it 
was written during...” 
“Long ago,” Jon broke in. “What about the Others?” 
“I found mention of dragonglass. The children of the forest used to give the Night’s Watch a 
hundred obsidian daggers every year, during the Age of Heroes. The Others come when it is 
cold, most of the tales agree. Or else it gets cold when they come. Sometimes they appear during 
snowstorms and melt away when the skies clear. They hide from the light of the sun and emerge 
by night... or else night falls when they emerge. Some stories speak of them riding the corpses of 
dead animals. Bears, direwolves, mammoths, horses, it makes no matter, so long as the beast is 
dead. The one that killed Small Paul was riding a dead horse, so that part’s plainly true. Some 
accounts speak of giant ice spiders too. I don’t know what those are. Men who fall in battle 
against the Others must be burned, or else the dead will rise again as their thralls.” 
“We knew all this. The question is, how do we fight them?” 
“The armor of the Others is proof against most ordinary blades, if the tales can be believed,” 
said Sam, “and their own swords are so cold they shatter steel. Fire will dismay them, though, 
and they are vulnerable to obsidian.” He remembered the one he had faced in the haunted forest, 
and how it had seemed to melt away when he stabbed it with the dragonglass dagger Jon had 
made for him. “I found one account of the Long Night that spoke of the last hero slaying Others 
with a blade of dragonsteel. Supposedly they could not stand against it.” 
“Dragonsteel?” Jon frowned. “Valyrian steel?” 
“That was my first thought as well.” 
“So if I can just convince the lords of the Seven Kingdoms to give us their Valyrian blades, all 
is saved? That won’t be hard.” His laugh had no mirth in it. “Did you find who the Others are, 
where they come from, what they want?” 
“Not yet, my lord, but it may be that I’ve just been reading the wrong books. There are 
hundreds I have not looked at yet. Give me more time and I will find whatever there is to be 
found.” 

“There is no more time.” Jon sounded sad. “You need to get your things together, Sam. You’re 
going with Gilly.” 
“Going?” For a moment Sam did not understand. “I’m going? To Eastwatch, my lord? Or... 
where am I...” 
“Oldtown.” 
“Oldtown?” It came out in a squeak. Horn Hill was close to Oldtown. Home. The notion made 
him light-headed. My father. 
“Aemon as well.” 
“Aemon? Maester Aemon? But... he’s one hundred and two years old, my lord, he can’t... 
you’re sending him and me? Who will tend the ravens? If they’re sick or wounded, who...” 
“Clydas. He’s been with Aemon for years.” 
“Clydas is only a steward, and his eyes are going bad. You need a maester. Maester Aemon is 
so frail, a sea voyage...” He thought of the Arbor and the Arbor Queen, and almost choked on his 
tongue. “It might... he’s old, and...” 
“His life will be at risk. I am aware of that, Sam, but the risk is greater here. Stannis knows who 
Aemon is. If the red woman requires king’s blood for her spells...” 
“Oh.” Sam paled. 
“Dareon will join you at Eastwatch. My hope is that his songs will win some men for us in the 
south. The Blackbird will deliver you to Braavos. From there you’ll arrange your own passage to 
Oldtown. If you still mean to claim Gilly’s babe as your bastard, send her and the child on to 
Horn Hill. Elsewise, Aemon will find a servant’s place for her at the Citadel.” 
“My b-b-bastard.” He had said that, yes, but... All that water. I could drown. Ships sink all the 
time, and autumn is a stormy season. Gilly would be with him, though, and the babe would grow 
up safe. “Yes, I... my mother and my sisters will help Gilly with the child.” I can send a letter, I 
won’t need to go to Horn Hill myself. “Dareon could see her to Oldtown just as well as me. 
I’m... I’ve been working at my archery every afternoon with Ulmer, as you commanded... well, 
except when I’m in the vaults, but you told me to find out about the Others. The longbow makes 
my shoulders ache and raises blisters on my fingers.” He showed Jon where one had burst. “I 
still do it, though. I can hit the target more often than not now, but I’m still the worst archer who 
ever bent a bow. I like Ulmer’s stories, though. Someone needs to write them down and put them 
in a book.” 
“You do it. They have parchment and ink at the Citadel, as well as longbows. I will expect you 
to continue with your practice. Sam, the Night’s Watch has hundreds of men who can loose an 
arrow, but only a handful who can read or write. I need you to become my new maester.” 
The word made him flinch. No, Father, please, I won’t speak of it again, I swear it by the 
Seven. Let me out, please let me out. “My lord, I... my work is here, the books...” 
“... will be here when you return to us.” 
Sam put a hand to his throat. He could almost feel the chain there, choking him. “My lord, the 
Citadel... they make you cut up corpses there.” They make you wear a chain about your neck. If 
it is chains you want, come with me. For three days and three nights Sam had sobbed himself to 

sleep, manacled hand and foot to a wall. The chain around his throat was so tight it broke the 
skin, and whenever he rolled the wrong way in his sleep it would cut off his breath. “I cannot 
wear a chain.” 
“You can. You will. Maester Aemon is old and blind. His strength is leaving him. Who will 
take his place when he dies? Maester Mullin at the Shadow Tower is more fighter than scholar, 
and Maester Harmune of Eastwatch is drunk more than he’s sober.” 
“If you ask the Citadel for more maesters...” 
“I mean to. We’ll have need of every one. Aemon Targaryen is not so easily replaced, 
however.” Jon seemed puzzled. “I was certain this would please you. There are so many books at 
the Citadel that no man can hope to read them all. You would do well there, Sam. I know you 
would.” 
“No. I could read the books, but... a m-maester must be a healer and b-b-blood makes me faint.” 
He held out a shaky hand for Jon to see. “I’m Sam the Scared, not Sam the Slayer.” 
“Scared? Of what? The chidings of old men? Sam, you saw the wights come swarming up the 
Fist, a tide of living dead men with black hands and bright blue eyes. You slew an Other.” 
“It was the d-d-d-dragonglass, not me.” 
“Be quiet. You lied and schemed and plotted to make me Lord Commander. You will obey me. 
You’ll go to the Citadel and forge a chain, and if you have to cut up corpses, so be it. At least in 
Oldtown the corpses won’t object.” 
He doesn’t understand. “My lord,” Sam said, “my f-f-f-father, Lord Randyll, he, he, he, he, he... 
the life of a maester is a life of servitude.” He was babbling, he knew. “No son of House Tarly 
will ever wear a chain. The men of Horn Hill do not bow and scrape to petty lords.” If it is chains 
you want, come with me. “Jon, I cannot disobey my father.” 
Jon, he’d said, but Jon was gone. It was Lord Snow who faced him now, grey eyes as hard as 
ice. “You have no father,” said Lord Snow. “Only brothers. Only us. Your life belongs to the 
Night’s Watch, so go and stuff your smallclothes into a sack, along with anything else you care 
to take to Oldtown. You leave an hour before sunrise. And here’s another order. From this day 
forth, you will not call yourself a craven. You’ve faced more things this past year than most men 
face in a lifetime. You can face the Citadel, but you’ll face it as a Sworn Brother of the Night’s 
Watch. I can’t command you to be brave, but I can command you to hide your fears. You said 
the words, Sam. Remember?” 
I am the sword in the darkness. But he was wretched with a sword, and the darkness scared 
him. “I... I’ll try.” 
“You won’t try. You will obey.” 
“Obey.” Mormont’s raven flapped its great black wings. 
“As my lord commands. Does... does Maester Aemon know?” 
“It was as much his idea as mine.” Jon opened the door for him. “No farewells. The fewer folk 
who know of this, the better. An hour before first light, by the lichyard.” 
Sam did not recall leaving the armory. The next thing he knew he was stumbling through mud 
and patches of old snow, toward Maester Aemon’s chambers. I could hide, he told himself. I 

could hide in the vaults amongst the books. I could live down there with the mouse and sneak up 
at night to steal food. Crazed thoughts, he knew, as futile as they were desperate. The vaults were 
the first place they would look for him. The last place they would look for him was beyond the 
Wall, but that was even madder. The wildlings would catch me and kill me slowly. They might 
burn me alive, the way the red woman means to burn Mance Rayder. 
When he found Maester Aemon in the rookery, he gave him Jon’s letter and blurted out his 
fears in a great green gush of words. “He does not understand.” Sam felt as if he might throw up. 
“If I don a chain, my lord f-f-f-father... he, he, he...” 
“My own father raised the same objections when I chose a life of service,” the old man said. “It 
was his father who sent me to the Citadel. King Daeron had sired four sons, and three had sons 
of their own. Too many dragons are as dangerous as too few, I heard His Grace tell my lord 
father, the day they sent me off.” Aemon raised a spotted hand to the chain of many metals that 
dangled loose about his thin neck. “The chain is heavy, Sam, but my grandsire had the right of it. 
So does your Lord Snow.” 
“Snow,” a raven muttered. “Snow,” another echoed. All of them picked it up then. “Snow, 
snow, snow, snow, snow.” Sam had taught them that word. There was no help here, he saw. 
Maester Aemon was as trapped as he was. He will die at sea, he thought, despairing. He is too 
old to survive such a voyage. Gilly’s little son may die as well, he’s not as large and strong as 
Dalla’s boy. Does Jon mean to kill us all? 
The next morning, Sam found himself saddling the mare he’d ridden from Horn Hill and 
leading her toward the lichyard beside the eastern road. Her saddlebags bulged with cheese and 
sausages and hard-cooked eggs, and half a salted ham that Three-Finger Hobb had given him on 
his name day. “You’re a man who appreciates cooking, Slayer,” the cook had said. “We need 
more o’ your sort.” The ham would help, no doubt. Eastwatch was a long cold ride away, and 
there were no towns nor inns in the shadow of the Wall. 
The hour before dawn was dark and still. Castle Black seemed strangely hushed. At the 
lichyard, a pair of two-wheeled wayns awaited him, along with Black Jack Bulwer and a dozen 
seasoned rangers, tough as the garrons they rode. Kedge Whiteye cursed loudly when his one 
good eye spied Sam. “Don’t mind him, Slayer,” said Black Jack. “He lost a wager, said we’d 
need to drag you out squealing from beneath some bed.” 
Maester Aemon was too frail to ride a horse, so a wayn had been made ready for him, its bed 
heaped high with furs, and a leather awning fastened overhead to keep off the rain and snow. 
Gilly and her child would ride with him. The second wayn would carry their clothing and 
possessions, along with a chest of rare old books that Aemon thought the Citadel might lack. 
Sam had spent half the night searching for them, though he’d found only one in four. And a good 
thing, or we’d need another wayn. 
When the maester appeared, he was bundled up in a bearskin three times his size. As Clydas led 
him toward the wayn, a gust of wind came up, and the old man staggered. Sam hurried to his side 
and put an arm about him. Another gust like that could blow him over the Wall. “Keep hold of 
my arm, maester. It’s not far.” 

The blind man nodded as the wind pushed back their hoods. “It is always warm in Oldtown. 
There is an inn on an island in the Honeywine where I used to go when I was a young novice. It 
will be pleasant to sit there once again, sipping cider.” 
By the time they got the maester into the wayn, Gilly had appeared, the child bundled in her 
arms. Beneath her hood her eyes were red from crying. Jon turned up at the same time, with 
Dolorous Edd. “Lord Snow,” Maester Aemon called, “I left a book for you in my chambers. The 
Jade Compendium. It was written by the Volantene adventurer Colloquo Votar, who traveled to 
the east and visited all the lands of the Jade Sea. There is a passage you may find of interest. I’ve 
told Clydas to mark it for you.” 
“I’ll be sure to read it,” Jon Snow replied. 
A line of pale snot ran from Maester Aemon’s nose. He wiped it away with the back of his 
glove. “Knowledge is a weapon, Jon. Arm yourself well before you ride forth to battle.” 
“I will.” A light snow had begun to fall, the big soft flakes drifting down lazily from the sky. 
Jon turned to Black Jack Bulwer. “Make as good a time as you can, but take no foolish risks. 
You have an old man and a suckling babe with you. See that you keep them warm and well fed.” 
“You do the same, m’lord,” said Gilly. “You do the same for t’other. Find another wet nurse, 
like you said. You promised me you would. The boy... Dalla’s boy... the little prince, I mean... 
you find him some good woman, so he grows up big and strong.” 
“You have my word,” Jon Snow said solemnly. 
“Don’t you name him. Don’t you do that till he’s past two years. It’s ill luck to name them 
when they’re still on the breast. You crows may not know that, but it’s true.” 
“As you command, my lady.” 
A spasm of anger flashed across Gilly’s face. “Don’t you call me that. I’m a mother, not a lady. 
I’m Craster’s wife and Craster’s daughter, and a mother.” 
Dolorous Edd took the babe as Gilly climbed into the wayn and covered her legs with some 
musty pelts. By then the eastern sky was more grey than black. Left Hand Lew was anxious to be 
off. Edd handed the infant up and Gilly put him to her breast. This may be the last I ever see of 
Castle Black, thought Sam as he hoisted himself atop his mare. As much as he had once hated 
Castle Black, it was tearing him apart to leave it. 
“Let’s do this,” Bulwer commanded. A whip snapped, and the wayns began to rumble slowly 
down the rutted road as the snow came down around them. Sam lingered beside Clydas and 
Dolorous Edd and Jon Snow. “Well,” he said, “farewell.” 
“And to you, Sam,” said Dolorous Edd. “Your boat’s not like to sink, I don’t think. Boats only 
sink when I’m aboard.” 
Jon was watching the wayns. “The first time I saw Gilly,” he said, “she was pressed back 
against the wall of Craster’s Keep, this skinny dark-haired girl with her big belly, cringing away 
from Ghost. He had gotten in among her rabbits, and I think she was frightened that he would 
tear her open and devour the babe... but it was not the wolf she should have been afraid of, was 
it?” 
No, Sam thought. Craster was the danger, her own father. 

“She has more courage than she knows.” 
“So do you, Sam. Have a swift, safe voyage, and take care of her and Aemon and the child.” 
Jon smiled a strange, sad smile. “And pull your hood up. The snowflakes are melting in your 
hair.” 

ARYA 
Faint and far away the light burned, low on the horizon, shining through the sea mists. 
“It looks like a star,” said Arya. 
“The star of home,” said Denyo. 
His father was shouting orders. Sailors scrambled up and down the three tall masts and moved 
along the rigging, reefing the heavy purple sails. Below, oarsmen heaved and strained over two 
great banks of oars. The decks tilted, creaking, as the galleas Titan’s Daughter heeled to 
starboard and began to come about. 
The star of home. Arya stood at the prow, one hand resting on the gilded figurehead, a maiden 
with a bowl of fruit. For half a heartbeat she let herself pretend that it was her home ahead. 
But that was stupid. Her home was gone, her parents dead, and all her brothers slain but Jon 
Snow on the Wall. That was where she had wanted to go. She told the captain as much, but even 
the iron coin did not sway him. Arya never seemed to find the places she set out to reach. Yoren 
had sworn to deliver her to Winterfell, only she had ended up in Harrenhal and Yoren in his 
grave. When she escaped Harrenhal for Riverrun, Lem and Anguy and Tom o’ Sevens took her 
captive and dragged her to the hollow hill instead. Then the Hound had stolen her and dragged 
her to the Twins. Arya had left him dying by the river and gone ahead to Saltpans, hoping to take 
passage for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, only... 
Braavos might not be so bad. Syrio was from Braavos, and Jaqen might be there as well. It was 
Jaqen who had given her the iron coin. He hadn’t truly been her friend, the way that Syrio had, 
but what good had friends ever done her? I don’t need any friends, so long as I have Needle. She 
brushed the ball of her thumb across the sword’s smooth pommel, wishing, wishing... 
If truth be told, Arya did not know what to wish for, any more than she knew what awaited her 
beneath that distant light. The captain had given her passage but he had no time to speak with 
her. Some of the crew shunned her, but others gave her gifts—a silver fork, fingerless gloves, a 
floppy woolen hat patched with leather. One man showed her how to tie sailor’s knots. Another 
poured her thimble cups of fire wine. The friendly ones would tap their chests, repeating their 
names over and over until Arya said them back, though none ever thought to ask her name. They 
called her Salty, since she’d come aboard at Saltpans, near the mouth of the Trident. It was as 
good a name as any, she supposed. 
The last of the night’s stars had vanished... all but the pair dead ahead. “It’s two stars now.” 
“Two eyes,” said Denyo. “The Titan sees us.” 
The Titan of Braavos. Old Nan had told them stories of the Titan back in Winterfell. He was a 
giant as tall as a mountain, and whenever Braavos stood in danger he would wake with fire in his 
eyes, his rocky limbs grinding and groaning as he waded out into the sea to smash the enemies. 
“The Braavosi feed him on the juicy pink flesh of little highborn girls,” Nan would end, and 
Sansa would give a stupid squeak. But Maester Luwin said the Titan was only a statue, and Old 
Nan’s stories were only stories. 

Winterfell is burned and fallen, Arya reminded herself. Old Nan and Maester Luwin were both 
dead, most like, and Sansa too. It did no good to think of them. All men must die. That was what 
the words meant, the words that Jaqen H’ghar had taught her when he gave her the worn iron 
coin. She had learned more Braavosi words since they left Saltpans, the words for please and 
thank you and sea and star and fire wine, but she came to them knowing that all men must die. 
Most of the Daughter’s crew had a smattering of the Common Tongue from nights ashore in 
Oldtown and King’s Landing and Maidenpool, though only the captain and his sons spoke it well 
enough to talk to her. Denyo was the youngest of those sons, a plump, cheerful boy of twelve 
who kept his father’s cabin and helped his eldest brother do his sums. 
“I hope your Titan isn’t hungry,” Arya told him. 
“Hungry?” Denyo said, confused. 
“It takes no matter.” Even if the Titan did eat juicy pink girl flesh, Arya would not fear him. 
She was a scrawny thing, no proper meal for a giant, and almost eleven, practically a woman 
grown. And Salty isn’t highborn, either. “Is the Titan the god of Braavos?” she asked. “Or do 
you have the Seven?” 
“All gods are honored in Braavos.” The captain’s son loved to talk about his city almost as 
much as he loved to talk about his father’s ship. “Your Seven have a sept here, the Sept-Beyond-
the-Sea, but only Westerosi sailors worship there.” 
They are not my Seven. They were my mother’s gods, and they let the Freys murder her at the 
Twins. She wondered whether she would find a godswood in Braavos, with a weirwood at its 
heart. Denyo might know, but she could not ask him. Salty was from Saltpans, and what would a 
girl from Saltpans know about the old gods of the north? The old gods are dead, she told herself, 
with Mother and Father and Robb and Bran and Rickon, all dead. A long time ago, she 
remembered her father saying that when the cold winds blow the lone wolf dies and the pack 
survives. He had it all backwards. Arya, the lone wolf, still lived, but the wolves of the pack had 
been taken and slain and skinned. 
“The Moonsingers led us to this place of refuge, where the dragons of Valyria could not find 
us,” Denyo said. “Theirs is the greatest temple. We esteem the Father of Waters as well, but his 
house is built anew whenever he takes his bride. The rest of the gods dwell together on an isle in 
the center of the city. That is where you will find the... the Many-Faced God.” 
The Titan’s eyes seemed brighter now, and farther apart. Arya did not know any Many-Faced 
God, but if he answered prayers, he might be the god she sought. Ser Gregor, she thought, 
Dunsen, Raff the Sweetling, Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, Queen Cersei. Only six now. Joffrey was dead, 
the Hound had slain Polliver, and she’d stabbed the Tickler herself, and that stupid squire with 
the pimple. I wouldn’t have killed him if he hadn’t grabbed me. The Hound had been dying 
when she left him on the banks of the Trident, burning up with fever from his wound. I should 
have given him the gift of mercy and put a knife into his heart. 
“Salty, look!” Denyo took her by the arm and turned her. “Can you see? There.” He pointed. 
The mists gave way before them, ragged grey curtains parted by their prow. The Titan’s 
Daughter cleaved through the grey-green waters on billowing purple wings. Arya could hear the 

cries of seabirds overhead. There, where Denyo pointed, a line of stony ridges rose sudden from 
the sea, their steep slopes covered with soldier pines and black spruce. But dead ahead the sea 
had broken through, and there above the open water the Titan towered, with his eyes blazing and 
his long green hair blowing in the wind. 
His legs bestrode the gap, one foot planted on each mountain, his shoulders looming tall above 
the jagged crests. His legs were carved of solid stone, the same black granite as the sea monts on 
which he stood, though around his hips he wore an armored skirt of greenish bronze. His 
breastplate was bronze as well, and his head in his crested halfhelm. His blowing hair was made 
of hempen ropes dyed green, and huge fires burned in the caves that were his eyes. One hand 
rested atop the ridge to his left, bronze fingers coiled about a knob of stone; the other thrust up 
into the air, clasping the hilt of a broken sword. 
He is only a little bigger than King Baelor’s statue in King’s Landing, she told herself when 
they were still well off to sea. As the galleas drove closer to where the breakers smashed against 
the ridgeline, however, the Titan grew larger still. She could hear Denyo’s father bellowing 
commands in his deep voice, and up in the rigging men were bringing in the sails. We are going 
to row beneath the Titan’s legs. Arya could see the arrow slits in the great bronze breastplate, 
and stains and speckles on the Titan’s arms and shoulders where the seabirds nested. Her neck 
craned upward. Baelor the Blessed would not reach his knee. He could step right over the walls 
of Winterfell. 
Then the Titan gave a mighty roar. 
The sound was as huge as he was, a terrible groaning and grinding, so loud it drowned out even 
the captain’s voice and the crash of the waves against those pine-clad ridges. A thousand 
seabirds took to the air at once, and Arya flinched until she saw that Denyo was laughing. “He 
warns the Arsenal of our coming, that is all,” he shouted. “You must not be afraid.” 
“I never was,” Arya shouted back. “It was loud, is all.” 
Wind and wave had the Titan’s Daughter hard in hand now, driving her swiftly toward the 
channel. Her double bank of oars stroked smoothly, lashing the sea to white foam as the Titan’s 
shadow fell upon them. For a moment it seemed as though they must surely smash up against the 
stones beneath his legs. Huddled by Denyo at the prow, Arya could taste salt where the spray had 
touched her face. She had to look straight up to see the Titan’s head. “The Braavosi feed him on 
the juicy pink flesh of little highborn girls,” she heard Old Nan say again, but she was not a little 
girl, and she would not be frightened of a stupid statue. 
Even so, she kept one hand on Needle as they slipped between his legs. More arrow slits dotted 
the insides of those great stone thighs, and when Arya craned her neck around to watch the 
crow’s nest slip through with a good ten yards to spare, she spied murder holes beneath the 
Titan’s armored skirts, and pale faces staring down at them from behind the iron bars. 
And then they were past. 
The shadow lifted, the pine-clad ridges fell away to either side, the winds dwindled, and they 
found themselves moving through a great lagoon. Ahead rose another sea mont, a knob of rock 
that pushed up from the water like a spiked fist, its stony battlements bristling with scorpions, 

spitfires, and trebuchets. “The Arsenal of Braavos,” Denyo named it, as proud as if he’d built it. 
“They can build a war galley there in a day.” Arya could see dozens of galleys tied up at quays 
and perched on launching slips. The painted prows of others poked from innumerable wooden 
sheds along the stony shores, like hounds in a kennel, lean and mean and hungry, waiting for a 
hunter’s horn to call them forth. She tried to count them, but there were too many, and more 
docks and sheds and quays where the shoreline curved away. 
Two galleys had come out to meet them. They seemed to skim upon the water like dragonflies, 
their pale oars flashing. Arya heard the captain shouting to them and their own captains shouting 
back, but she did not understand the words. A great horn sounded. The galleys passed to either 
side of them, so close that she could hear the muffled sound of drums from within their purple 
hulls, bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom, like the beat of living hearts. 
Then the galleys were behind them, and the Arsenal as well. Ahead stretched a broad expanse 
of pea-green water rippled like a sheet of colored glass. From its wet heart arose the city proper, 
a great sprawl of domes and towers and bridges, grey and gold and red. The hundred isles of 
Braavos in the sea. 
Maester Luwin had taught them about Braavos, but Arya had forgotten much of what he’d said. 
It was a flat city, she could see that even from afar, not like King’s Landing on its three high 
hills. The only hills here were the ones that men had raised of brick and granite, bronze and 
marble. Something else was missing as well, though it took her a few moments to realize what it 
was. The city has no walls. But when she said as much to Denyo, he laughed at her. “Our walls 
are made of wood and painted purple,” he told her. “Our galleys are our walls. We need no 
other.” 
The deck creaked behind them. Arya turned to find Denyo’s father looming over them in his 
long captain’s coat of purple wool. Tradesman-Captain Ternesio Terys wore no whiskers and 
kept his grey hair cut short and neat, framing his square, windburnt face. On the crossing she had 
oft seen him jesting with his crew, but when he frowned men ran from him as if before a storm. 
He was frowning now. “Our voyage is at an end,” he told Arya. “We make for the Chequy Port, 
where the Sealord’s customs officers will come aboard to inspect our holds. They will be half a 
day at it, they always are, but there is no need for you to wait upon their pleasure. Gather your 
belongings. I shall lower a boat, and Yorko will put you ashore.” 
Ashore. Arya bit her lip. She had crossed the narrow sea to get here, but if the captain had asked 
she would have told him she wanted to stay aboard the Titan’s Daughter. Salty was too small to 
man an oar, she knew that now, but she could learn to splice ropes and reef the sails and steer a 
course across the great salt seas. Denyo had taken her up to the crow’s nest once, and she hadn’t 
been afraid at all, though the deck had seemed a tiny thing below her. I can do sums too, and 
keep a cabin neat. 
But the galleas had no need of a second boy. Besides, she had only to look at the captain’s face 
to know how anxious he was to be rid of her. So Arya only nodded. “Ashore,” she said, though 
ashore meant only strangers. 

“Valar dohaeris.” He touched two fingers to his brow. “I beg you remember Ternesio Terys and 
the service he has done you.” 
“I will,” Arya said in a small voice. The wind tugged at her cloak, insistent as a ghost. It was 
time she was away. 
Gather your belongings, the captain had said, but there were few enough of those. Only the 
clothes she was wearing, her little pouch of coins, the gifts the crew had given her, the dagger on 
her left hip and Needle on her right. 
The boat was ready before she was, and Yorko was at the oars. He was the captain’s son as 
well, but older than Denyo and less friendly. I never said farewell to Denyo, she thought as she 
clambered down to join him. She wondered if she would ever see the boy again. I should have 
said farewell. 
The Titan’s Daughter dwindled in their wake, while the city grew larger with every stroke of 
Yorko’s oars. A harbor was visible off to her right, a tangle of piers and quays crowded with big-
bellied whalers out of Ibben, swan ships from the Summer Isles, and more galleys than a girl 
could count. Another harbor, more distant, was off to her left, beyond a sinking point of land 
where the tops of half-drowned buildings thrust themselves above the water. Arya had never 
seen so many big buildings all together in one place. King’s Landing had the Red Keep and the 
Great Sept of Baelor and the Dragonpit, but Braavos seemed to boast a score of temples and 
towers and palaces that were as large or even larger. I will be a mouse again, she thought glumly, 
the way I was in Harrenhal before I ran away. 
The city had seemed like one big island from where the Titan stood, but as Yorko rowed them 
closer she saw that it was many small islands close together, linked by arched stone bridges that 
spanned innumerable canals. Beyond the harbor she glimpsed streets of grey stone houses, built 
so close they leaned one upon the other. To Arya’s eyes they were queer-looking, four and five 
stories tall and very skinny, with sharp-peaked tile roofs like pointed hats. She saw no thatch, 
and only a few timbered houses of the sort she knew in Westeros. They have no trees, she 
realized. Braavos is all stone, a grey city in a green sea. 
Yorko swung them north of the docks and down the gullet of a great canal, a broad green 
waterway that ran straight into the heart of the city. They passed under the arches of a carved 
stone bridge, decorated with half a hundred kinds of fish and crabs and squids. A second bridge 
appeared ahead, this one carved in lacy leafy vines, and beyond that a third, gazing down on 
them from a thousand painted eyes. The mouths of lesser canals opened to either side, and others 
still smaller off of those. Some of the houses were built above the waterways, she saw, turning 
the canals into a sort of tunnel. Slender boats slid in and out among them, wrought in the shapes 
of water serpents with painted heads and upraised tails. Those were not rowed but poled, she 
saw, by men who stood at their sterns in cloaks of grey and brown and deep moss green. She saw 
huge flat-bottomed barges too, heaped high with crates and barrels and pushed along by twenty 
polemen to a side, and fancy floating houses with lanterns of colored glass, velvet drapes, and 
brazen figureheads. Off in the far distance, looming above canals and houses both, was a massive 
grey stone roadway of some kind, supported by three tiers of mighty arches marching away south 

into the haze. “What’s that?” Arya asked Yorko, pointing. “The sweetwater river,” he told her. 
“It brings fresh water from the mainland, across the mudflats and the briny shallows. Good sweet 
water for the fountains.” 
When she looked behind her, the harbor and lagoon were lost to sight. Ahead, a row of mighty 
statues stood along both sides of the channel, solemn stone men in long bronze robes, spattered 
with the droppings of the seabirds. Some held books, some daggers, some hammers. One 
clutched a golden star in his upraised hand. Another was upending a stone flagon to send an 
endless stream of water splashing down into the canal. “Are they gods?” asked Arya. 
“Sealords,” said Yorko. “The Isle of the Gods is farther on. See? Six bridges down, on the right 
bank. That is the Temple of the Moonsingers.” 
It was one of those that Arya had spied from the lagoon, a mighty mass of snow-white marble 
topped by a huge silvered dome whose milk glass windows showed all the phases of the moon. A 
pair of marble maidens flanked its gates, tall as the Sealords, supporting a crescent-shaped lintel. 
Beyond it stood another temple, a red stone edifice as stern as any fortress. Atop its great square 
tower a fire blazed in an iron brazier twenty feet across, whilst smaller fires flanked its brazen 
doors. “The red priests love their fires,” Yorko told her. “The Lord of Light is their god, red 
R’hllor.” 
I know. Arya remembered Thoros of Myr in his bits of old armor, worn over robes so faded that 
he had seemed more a pink priest than a red one. Yet his kiss had brought Lord Beric back from 
death. She watched the red god’s house drift by, wondering whether these Braavosi priests of his 
could do the same. 
Next came a huge brick structure festooned with lichen. Arya might have taken it for a 
storehouse had not Yorko said, “That is the Holy Refuge, where we honor the small gods the 
world has forgotten. You will hear it called the Warren too.” A small canal ran between the 
Warren’s looming lichen-covered walls, and there he swung them right. They passed through a 
tunnel and out again into the light. More shrines loomed up to either side. 
“I never knew there were so many gods,” Arya said. 
Yorko grunted. They went around a bend and beneath another bridge. On their left appeared a 
rocky knoll with a windowless temple of dark grey stone at its top. A flight of stone steps led 
from its doors down to a covered dock. 
Yorko backed the oars, and the boat bumped gently against stone pilings. He grasped an iron 
ring set to hold them for a moment. “Here I leave you.” 
The dock was shadowed, the steps steep. The temple’s black tile roof came to a sharp peak, like 
the houses along the canals. Arya chewed her lip. Syrio came from Braavos. He might have 
visited this temple. He might have climbed those steps. She grabbed a ring and pulled herself up 
onto the dock. 
“You know my name,” said Yorko from the boat. 
“Yorko Terys.” 
“Valar dohaeris.” He pushed off with his oar and drifted back off into the deeper water. Arya 
watched him row back the way they’d come, until he vanished in the shadows of the bridge. As 

the swish of oars faded, she could almost hear the beating of her heart. Suddenly she was 
somewhere else... back in Harrenhal with Gendry, maybe, or with the Hound in the woods along 
the Trident. Salty is a stupid child, she told herself. I am a wolf, and will not be afraid. She patted 
Needle’s hilt for luck and plunged into the shadows, taking the steps two at a time so no one 
could ever say she’d been afraid. 
At the top she found a set of carved wooden doors twelve feet high. The left-hand door was 
made of weirwood pale as bone, the right of gleaming ebony. In their center was a carved moon 
face; ebony on the weirwood side, weirwood on the ebony. The look of it reminded her somehow 
of the heart tree in the godswood at Winterfell. The doors are watching me, she thought. She 
pushed upon both doors at once with the flat of her gloved hands, but neither one would budge. 
Locked and barred. “Let me in, you stupid,” she said. “I crossed the narrow sea.” She made a fist 
and pounded. “Jaqen told me to come. I have the iron coin.” She pulled it from her pouch and 
held it up. “See? Valar morghulis.” 
The doors made no reply, except to open. 
They opened inward all in silence, with no human hand to move them. Arya took a step 
forward, and another. The doors closed behind her, and for a moment she was blind. Needle was 
in her hand, though she did not remember drawing it. 
A few candles burned along the walls, but gave so little light that Arya could not see her own 
feet. Someone was whispering, too softly for her to make out words. Someone else was weeping. 
She heard light footfalls, leather sliding over stone, a door opening and closing. Water, I hear 
water too. 
Slowly her eyes adjusted. The temple seemed much larger within than it had without. The septs 
of Westeros were seven-sided, with seven altars for the seven gods, but here there were more 
gods than seven. Statues of them stood along the walls, massive and threatening. Around their 
feet red candles flickered, as dim as distant stars. The nearest was a marble woman twelve feet 
tall. Real tears were trickling from her eyes, to fill the bowl she cradled in her arms. Beyond her 
was a man with a lion’s head seated on a throne, carved of ebony. On the other side of the doors, 
a huge horse of bronze and iron reared up on two great legs. Farther on she could make out a 
great stone face, a pale infant with a sword, a shaggy black goat the size of an aurochs, a hooded 
man leaning on a staff. The rest were only looming shapes to her, half-seen through the gloom. 
Between the gods were hidden alcoves thick with shadows, with here and there a candle burning. 
Silent as a shadow, Arya moved between rows of long stone benches, her sword in hand. The 
floor was made of stone, her feet told her; not polished marble like the floor of the Great Sept of 
Baelor, but something rougher. She passed some women whispering together. The air was warm 
and heavy, so heavy that she yawned. She could smell the candles. The scent was unfamiliar, and 
she put it down to some queer incense, but as she got deeper into the temple, they seemed to 
smell of snow and pine needles and hot stew. Good smells, Arya told herself, and felt a little 
braver. Brave enough to slip Needle back into its sheath. 
In the center of the temple she found the water she had heard; a pool ten feet across, black as 
ink and lit by dim red candles. Beside it sat a young man in a silvery cloak, weeping softly. She 

watched him dip a hand in the water, sending scarlet ripples racing across the pool. When he 
drew his fingers back he sucked them, one by one. He must be thirsty. There were stone cups 
along the rim of the pool. Arya filled one and brought it to him, so he could drink. The young 
man stared at her for a long moment when she offered it to him. “Valar morghulis,” he said. 
“Valar dohaeris,” she replied. 
He drank deep, and dropped the cup into the pool with a soft plop. Then he pushed himself to 
his feet, swaying, holding his belly. For a moment Arya thought he was going to fall. It was only 
then that she saw the dark stain below his belt, spreading as she watched. “You’re stabbed,” she 
blurted, but the man paid her no mind. He lurched unsteadily toward the wall and crawled into an 
alcove onto a hard stone bed. When Arya peered around, she saw other alcoves too. On some 
there were old people sleeping. 
No, a half-remembered voice seemed to whisper in her head. They are dead, or dying. Look 
with your eyes. 
A hand touched her arm. 
Arya spun away, but it was only a little girl: a pale little girl in a cowled robe that seemed to 
engulf her, black on the right side and white on the left. Beneath the cowl was a gaunt and bony 
face, hollow cheeks, and dark eyes that looked as big as saucers. “Don’t grab me,” Arya warned 
the waif. “I killed the boy who grabbed me last.” 
The girl said some words that Arya did not know. 
She shook her head. “Don’t you know the Common Tongue?” 
A voice behind her said, “I do.” 
Arya did not like the way they kept surprising her. The hooded man was tall, enveloped in a 
larger version of the black-and-white robe the girl was wearing. Beneath his cowl all she could 
see was the faint red glitter of candlelight reflecting off his eyes. “What place is this?” she asked 
him. 
“A place of peace.” His voice was gentle. “You are safe here. This is the House of Black and 
White, my child. Though you are young to seek the favor of the Many-Faced God.” 
“Is he like the southron god, the one with seven faces?” 
“Seven? No. He has faces beyond count, little one, as many faces as there are stars in the sky. 
In Braavos, men worship as they will... but at the end of every road stands Him of Many Faces, 
waiting. He will be there for you one day, do not fear. You need not rush to his embrace.” 
“I only came to find Jaqen H’ghar.” 
“I do not know this name.” 
Her heart sank. “He was from Lorath. His hair was white on one side and red on the other. He 
said he’d teach me secrets, and gave me this.” The iron coin was clutched in her fist. When she 
opened her fingers, it clung to her sweaty palm. 
The priest studied the coin, though he made no move to touch it. The waif with the big eyes was 
looking at it too. Finally, the cowled man said, “Tell me your name, child.” 
“Salty. I come from Saltpans, by the Trident.” 

Though she could not see his face, somehow she could feel him smiling. “No,” he said. “Tell 
me your name.” 
“Squab,” she answered this time. 
“Your true name, child.” 
“My mother named me Nan, but they call me Weasel—” 
“Your name.” 
She swallowed. “Arry. I’m Arry.” 
“Closer. And now the truth?” 
Fear cuts deeper than swords, she told herself. “Arya.” She whispered the word the first time. 
The second time she threw it at him. “I am Arya, of House Stark.” 
“You are,” he said, “but the House of Black and White is no place for Arya, of House Stark.” 
“Please,” she said. “I have no place to go.” 
“Do you fear death?” 
She bit her lip. “No.” 
“Let us see.” The priest lowered his cowl. Beneath he had no face; only a yellowed skull with a 
few scraps of skin still clinging to the cheeks, and a white worm wriggling from one empty eye 
socket. “Kiss me, child,” he croaked, in a voice as dry and husky as a death rattle. 
Does he think to scare me? Arya kissed him where his nose should be and plucked the grave 
worm from his eye to eat it, but it melted like a shadow in her hand. 
The yellow skull was melting too, and the kindliest old man that she had ever seen was smiling 
down at her. “No one has ever tried to eat my worm before,” he said. “Are you hungry, child?” 
Yes, she thought, but not for food. 

CERSEI 
A cold rain was falling, turning the walls and ramparts of the Red Keep dark as blood. 
The queen held the king’s hand and led him firmly across the muddy yard to where her litter 
waited with its escort. “Uncle Jaime said I could ride my horse and throw pennies to the 
smallfolk,” the boy objected. 
“Do you want to catch a chill?” She would not risk it; Tommen had never been as robust as 
Joffrey. “Your grandfather would want you to look a proper king at his wake. We will not appear 
at the Great Sept wet and bedraggled.” Bad enough I must wear mourning again. Black had 
never been a happy color on her. With her fair skin, it made her look half a corpse herself. Cersei 
had risen an hour before dawn to bathe and fix her hair, and she did not intend to let the rain 
destroy her efforts. 
Inside the litter, Tommen settled back against his pillows and peered out at the falling rain. 
“The gods are weeping for grandfather. Lady Jocelyn says the raindrops are their tears.” 
“Jocelyn Swyft is a fool. If the gods could weep, they would have wept for your brother. Rain is 
rain. Close the curtain before you let any more in. That mantle is sable, would you have it 
soaked?” 
Tommen did as he was bid. His meekness troubled her. A king had to be strong. Joffrey would 
have argued. He was never easy to cow. “Don’t slump so,” she told Tommen. “Sit like a king. 
Put your shoulders back and straighten your crown. Do you want it to tumble off your head in 
front of all your lords?” 
“No, Mother.” The boy sat straight and reached up to fix the crown. Joff’s crown was too big 
for him. Tommen had always inclined to plumpness, but his face seemed thinner now. Is he 
eating well? She must remember to ask the steward. She could not risk Tommen growing ill, not 
with Myrcella in the hands of the Dornishmen. He will grow into Joff’s crown in time. Until he 
did, a smaller one might be needed, one that did not threaten to swallow his head. She would 
take it up with the goldsmiths. 
The litter made its slow way down Aegon’s High Hill. Two Kingsguard rode before them, 
white knights on white horses with white cloaks hanging sodden from their shoulders. Behind 
came fifty Lannister guardsmen in gold and crimson. 
Tommen peered through the drapes at the empty streets. “I thought there would be more people. 
When Father died, all the people came out to watch us go by.” 
“This rain has driven them inside.” King’s Landing had never loved Lord Tywin. He never 
wanted love, though. “You cannot eat love, nor buy a horse with it, nor warm your halls on a 
cold night,” she heard him tell Jaime once, when her brother had been no older than Tommen. 
At the Great Sept of Baelor, that magnificence in marble atop Visenya’s Hill, the little knot of 
mourners were outnumbered by the gold cloaks that Ser Addam Marbrand had drawn up across 
the plaza. More will turn out later, the queen told herself as Ser Meryn Trant helped her from the 
litter. Only the highborn and their retinues were to be admitted to the morning service; there 
would be another in the afternoon for the commons, and the evening prayers were open to all. 

Cersei would need to return for that, so that the smallfolk might see her mourn. The mob must 
have its show. It was a nuisance. She had offices to fill, a war to win, a realm to rule. Her father 
would have understood that. 
The High Septon met them at the top of the steps. A bent old man with a wispy grey beard, he 
was so stooped by the weight of his ornate embroidered robes that his eyes were on a level with 
the queen’s breasts... though his crown, an airy confection of cut crystal and spun gold, added a 
good foot and a half to his height. 
Lord Tywin had given him that crown to replace the one that was lost when the mob killed the 
previous High Septon. They had pulled the fat fool from his litter and torn him apart, the day 
Myrcella sailed for Dorne. That one was a great glutton, and biddable. This one... This High 
Septon was of Tyrion’s making, Cersei recalled suddenly. It was a disquieting thought. 
The old man’s spotted hand looked like a chicken claw as it poked from a sleeve encrusted with 
golden scrollwork and small crystals. Cersei knelt on the wet marble and kissed his fingers, and 
bid Tommen to do the same. What does he know of me? How much did the dwarf tell him? The 
High Septon smiled as he escorted her into the sept. But was it a threatening smile full of 
unspoken knowledge, or just some vacuous twitch of an old man’s wrinkled lips? The queen 
could not be certain. 
They made their way through the Hall of Lamps beneath colored globes of leaded glass, 
Tommen’s hand in hers. Trant and Kettleblack flanked them, water dripping from their wet 
cloaks to puddle on the floor. The High Septon walked slowly, leaning on a weirwood staff 
topped by a crystal orb. Seven of the Most Devout attended him, shimmering in cloth-of-silver. 
Tommen wore cloth-of-gold beneath his sable mantle, the queen an old gown of black velvet 
lined with ermine. There’d been no time to have a new one made, and she could not wear the 
same dress she had worn for Joffrey, nor the one she’d buried Robert in. 
At least I will not be expected to don mourning for Tyrion. I shall dress in crimson silk and 
cloth-of-gold for that, and wear rubies in my hair. The man who brought her the dwarf’s head 
would be raised to lordship, she had proclaimed, no matter how mean and low his birth or 
station. Ravens were carrying her promise to every part of the Seven Kingdoms, and soon 
enough word would cross the narrow sea to the Nine Free Cities and the lands beyond. Let the 
Imp run to the ends of the earth, he will not escape me. 
The royal procession passed through the inner doors into the cavernous heart of the Great Sept, 
and down a wide aisle, one of seven that met beneath the dome. To right and left, highborn 
mourners sank to their knees as the king and queen went by. Many of her father’s bannermen 
were here, and knights who had fought beside Lord Tywin in half a hundred battles. The sight of 
them made her feel more confident. I am not without friends. 
Under the Great Sept’s lofty dome of glass and gold and crystal, Lord Tywin Lannister’s body 
rested upon a stepped marble bier. At its head Jaime stood at vigil, his one good hand curled 
about the hilt of a tall golden greatsword whose point rested on the floor. The hooded cloak he 
wore was as white as freshly fallen snow, and the scales of his long hauberk were mother-of-
pearl chased with gold. Lord Tywin would have wanted him in Lannister gold and crimson, she 

thought. It always angered him to see Jaime all in white. Her brother was growing his beard 
again as well. The stubble covered his jaw and cheeks, and gave his face a rough, uncouth look. 
He might at least have waited till Father’s bones were interred beneath the Rock. 
Cersei led the king up three short steps, to kneel beside the body. Tommen’s eyes were filled 
with tears. “Weep quietly,” she told him, leaning close. “You are a king, not a squalling child. 
Your lords are watching you.” The boy swiped the tears away with the back of his hand. He had 
her eyes, emerald green, as large and bright as Jaime’s eyes had been when he was Tommen’s 
age. Her brother had been such a pretty boy... but fierce as well, as fierce as Joffrey, a true lion 
cub. The queen put her arm around Tommen and kissed his golden curls. He will need me to 
teach him how to rule and keep him safe from his enemies. Some of them stood around them 
even now, pretending to be friends. 
The silent sisters had armored Lord Tywin as if to fight some final battle. He wore his finest 
plate, heavy steel enameled a deep, dark crimson, with gold inlay on his gauntlets, greaves, and 
breastplate. His rondels were golden sunbursts; a golden lioness crouched upon each shoulder; a 
maned lion crested the greathelm beside his head. Upon his chest lay a longsword in a gilded 
scabbard studded with rubies, his hands folded about its hilt in gloves of gilded mail. Even in 
death his face is noble, she thought, although the mouth... The corners of her father’s lips curved 
upward ever so slightly, giving him a look of vague bemusement. That should not be. She 
blamed Pycelle; he should have told the silent sisters that Lord Tywin Lannister never smiled. 
The man is as useless as nipples on a breastplate. That half smile made Lord Tywin seem less 
fearful, somehow. That, and the fact that his eyes were closed. Her father’s eyes had always been 
unsettling; pale green, almost luminous, flecked with gold. His eyes could see inside you, could 
see how weak and worthless and ugly you were down deep. When he looked at you, you knew. 
Unbidden, a memory came to her, of the feast King Aerys had thrown when Cersei first came to 
court, a girl as green as summer grass. Old Merryweather had been nattering about raising the 
duty on wine when Lord Rykker said, “If we need gold, His Grace should sit Lord Tywin on his 
chamber pot.” Aerys and his lickspittles laughed loudly, whilst Father stared at Rykker over his 
wine cup. Long after the merriment had died that gaze had lingered. Rykker turned away, turned 
back, met Father’s eyes, then ignored them, drank a tankard of ale, and stalked off red-faced, 
defeated by a pair of unflinching eyes. 
Lord Tywin’s eyes are closed forever now, Cersei thought. It is my look they will flinch from 
now, my frown that they must fear. I am a lion too. 
It was gloomy within the sept with the sky so grey outside. If the rain ever stopped, the sun 
would slant down through the hanging crystals to drape the corpse in rainbows. The Lord of 
Casterly Rock deserved rainbows. He had been a great man. I shall be greater, though. A 
thousand years from now, when the maesters write about this time, you shall be remembered 
only as Queen Cersei’s sire. 
“Mother.” Tommen tugged her sleeve. “What smells so bad?” 
My lord father. “Death.” She could smell it too; a faint whisper of decay that made her want to 
wrinkle her nose. Cersei paid it no mind. The seven septons in the silver robes stood behind the 

bier, beseeching the Father Above to judge Lord Tywin justly. When they were done, seventy-
seven septas gathered before the altar of the Mother and began to sing to her for mercy. Tommen 
was fidgeting by then, and even the queen’s knees had begun to ache. She glanced at Jaime. Her 
twin stood as if he had been carved from stone, and would not meet her eyes. 
On the benches, their uncle Kevan knelt with his shoulders slumped, his son beside him. Lancel 
looks worse than Father. Though only seventeen, he might have passed for seventy; grey-faced, 
gaunt, with hollow cheeks, sunken eyes, and hair as white and brittle as chalk. How can Lancel 
be among the living when Tywin Lannister is dead? Have the gods taken leave of their wits? 
Lord Gyles was coughing more than usual and covering his nose with a square of red silk. He 
can smell it too. Grand Maester Pycelle had his eyes closed. If he has fallen asleep, I swear I will 
have him whipped. To the right of the bier knelt the Tyrells: the Lord of Highgarden, his hideous 
mother and vapid wife, his son Garlan and his daughter Margaery. Queen Margaery, she 
reminded herself; Joff’s widow and Tommen’s wife-to-be. Margaery looked very like her 
brother, the Knight of Flowers. The queen wondered if they had other things in common. Our 
little rose has a good many ladies waiting attendance on her, night and day. They were with her 
now, almost a dozen of them. Cersei studied their faces, wondering. Who is the most fearful, the 
most wanton, the hungriest for favor? Who has the loosest tongue? She would need to make a 
point of finding out. 
It was a relief when the singing finally ended. The smell coming off her father’s corpse seemed 
to have grown stronger. Most of the mourners had the decency to pretend that nothing was amiss, 
but Cersei saw two of Lady Margaery’s cousins wrinkling their little Tyrell noses. As she and 
Tommen were walking back down the aisle the queen thought she heard someone mutter “privy” 
and chortle, but when she turned her head to see who had spoken a sea of solemn faces gazed at 
her blankly. They would never have dared make japes about him when he was still alive. He 
would have turned their bowels to water with a look. 
Back out in the Hall of Lamps, the mourners buzzed about them thick as flies, eager to shower 
her with useless condolences. The Redwyne twins both kissed her hand, their father her cheeks. 
Hallyne the Pyromancer promised her that a flaming hand would burn in the sky above the city 
on the day her father’s bones went west. Between coughs, Lord Gyles told her that he had hired a 
master stonecarver to make a statue of Lord Tywin, to stand eternal vigil beside the Lion Gate. 
Ser Lambert Turnberry appeared with a patch over his right eye, swearing that he would wear it 
until he could bring her the head of her dwarf brother. 
No sooner had the queen escaped the clutches of that fool than she found herself cornered by 
Lady Falyse of Stokeworth and her husband, Ser Balman Byrch. “My lady mother sends her 
regrets, Your Grace,” Falyse burbled at her. “Lollys has been taken to bed with the child and she 
felt the need to stay with her. She begs that you forgive her, and said I should ask you... my 
mother admired your late father above all other men. Should my sister have a little boy, it is her 
wish that we might name him Tywin, if... if it please you.” 
Cersei stared at her, aghast. “Your lackwit sister gets herself raped by half of King’s Landing, 
and Tanda thinks to honor the bastard with my lord father’s name? I think not.” 

Falyse flinched back as if she’d been slapped, but her husband only stroked his thick blond 
mustache with a thumb. “I told Lady Tanda as much. We shall find a more, ah... a more fitting 
name for Lollys’s bastard, you have my word.” 
“See that you do.” Cersei showed them a shoulder and moved away. Tommen had fallen into 
the clutches of Margaery Tyrell and her grandmother, she saw. The Queen of Thorns was so 
short that for an instant Cersei took her for another child. Before she could rescue her son from 
the roses, the press brought her face-to-face with her uncle. When the queen reminded him of 
their meeting later, Ser Kevan gave a weary nod and begged leave to withdraw. But Lancel 
lingered, the very picture of a man with one foot in the grave. But is he climbing in or climbing 
out? 
Cersei forced herself to smile. “Lancel, I am happy to see you looking so much stronger. 
Maester Ballabar brought us such dire reports, we feared for your life. But I would have thought 
you on your way to Darry by now, to take up your lordship.” Her father had made Lancel a lord 
after the Battle of the Blackwater, as a sop to his brother Kevan. 
“Not as yet. There are outlaws in my castle.” Her cousin’s voice was as wispy as the mustache 
on his upper lip. Though his hair had gone white, his mustache fuzz remained a sandy color. 
Cersei had often gazed up at it while the boy was inside her, pumping dutifully away. It looks 
like a smudge of dirt on his lip. She used to threaten to scrub it off with a little spit. “The 
riverlands have need of a strong hand, my father says.” 
A pity that they’re getting yours, she wanted to say. Instead she smiled. “And you are to be wed 
as well.” 
A gloomy look passed across the young knight’s ravaged face. “A Frey girl, and not of my 
choosing. She is not even maiden. A widow, of Darry blood. My father says that will help me 
with the peasants, but the peasants are all dead.” He reached for her hand. “It is cruel, Cersei. 
Your Grace knows that I love—” 
“—House Lannister,” she finished for him. “No one can doubt that, Lancel. May your wife give 
you strong sons.” Best not let her lord grandfather host the wedding, though. “I know you will do 
many noble deeds in Darry.” 
Lancel nodded, plainly miserable. “When it seemed that I might die, my father brought the 
High Septon to pray for me. He is a good man.” Her cousin’s eyes were wet and shiny, a child’s 
eyes in an old man’s face. “He says the Mother spared me for some holy purpose, so I might 
atone for my sins.” 
Cersei wondered how he intended to atone for her. Knighting him was a mistake, and bedding 
him a bigger one. Lancel was a weak reed, and she liked his newfound piety not at all; he had 
been much more amusing when he was trying to be Jaime. What has this mewling fool told the 
High Septon? And what will he tell his little Frey when they lie together in the dark? If he 
confessed to bedding Cersei, well, she could weather that. Men were always lying about women; 
she would put it down as the braggadocio of a callow boy smitten by her beauty. If he sings of 
Robert and the strongwine, though... “Atonement is best achieved through prayer,” Cersei told 
him. “Silent prayer.” She left him to think about that and girded herself to face the Tyrell host. 

Margaery embraced her like a sister, which the queen found presumptuous, but this was not the 
place to reproach her. Lady Alerie and the cousins contented themselves with kissing fingers. 
Lady Graceford, who was large with child, asked the queen’s leave to name it Tywin if it were a 
boy, or Lanna if it were a girl. Another one? she almost groaned. The realm will drown in 
Tywins. She gave consent as graciously as she could, feigning delight. 
It was Lady Merryweather who truly pleased her. “Your Grace,” that one said, in her sultry 
Myrish tones, “I have sent word to my friends across the narrow sea, asking them to seize the 
Imp at once should he show his ugly face in the Free Cities.” 
“Do you have many friends across the water?” 
“In Myr, many. In Lys as well, and Tyrosh. Men of power.” 
Cersei could well believe it. The Myrish woman was too beautiful by half; long-legged and full-
breasted, with smooth olive skin, ripe lips, huge dark eyes, and thick black hair that always 
looked as if she’d just come from bed. She even smells of sin, like some exotic lotus. “Lord 
Merryweather and I wish only to serve Your Grace and the little king,” the woman purred, with a 
look that was as pregnant as Lady Graceford. 
This one is ambitious, and her lord is proud but poor. “We must speak again, my lady. Taena, is 
it? You are most kind. I know that we shall be great friends.” 
Then the Lord of Highgarden descended on her. 
Mace Tyrell was no more than ten years older than Cersei, yet she thought of him as her 
father’s age, not her own. He was not quite so tall as Lord Tywin had been, but elsewise he was 
bigger, with a thick chest and a gut grown even thicker. His hair was chestnut-colored, but there 
were specks of white and grey in his beard. His face was often red. “Lord Tywin was a great 
man, an extraordinary man,” he declared ponderously after he had kissed both her cheeks. “We 
shall never see his like again, I fear.” 
You are looking at his like, fool, Cersei thought. It is his daughter standing here before you. But 
she needed Tyrell and the strength of Highgarden to keep Tommen on his throne, so all she said 
was, “He will be greatly missed.” 
Tyrell put a hand upon her shoulder. “No man alive is fit to don Lord Tywin’s armor, that is 
plain. Still, the realm goes on, and must be ruled. If there is aught that I might do to serve in this 
dark hour, Your Grace need only ask.” 
If you want to be the King’s Hand, my lord, have the courage to say it plainly. The queen 
smiled. Let him read into that as much as he likes. “Surely my lord is needed in the Reach?” 
“My son Willas is an able lad,” the man replied, refusing to take her perfectly good hint. “His 
leg may be twisted but he has no want of wits. And Garlan will soon take Brightwater. Between 
them the Reach will be in good hands, if it happens that I am needed elsewhere. The governance 
of the realm must come first, Lord Tywin often said. And I am pleased to bring Your Grace good 
tidings in that regard. My uncle Garth has agreed to serve as master of coin, as your lord father 
wished. He is making his way to Oldtown to take ship. His sons will accompany him. Lord 
Tywin mentioned something about finding places for the two of them as well. Perhaps in the 
City Watch.” 

The queen’s smile had frozen so hard she feared her teeth might crack. Garth the Gross on the 
small council and his two bastards in the gold cloaks... do the Tyrells think I will just serve the 
realm up to them on a gilded platter? The arrogance of it took her breath away. 
“Garth has served me well as Lord Seneschal, as he served my father before me,” Tyrell was 
going on. “Littlefinger had a nose for gold, I grant you, but Garth—” 
“My lord,” Cersei broke in, “I fear there has been some misunderstanding. I have asked Lord 
Gyles Rosby to serve as our new master of coin, and he has done me the honor of accepting.” 
Mace gaped at her. “Rosby? That... cougher? But... the matter was agreed, Your Grace. Garth is 
on his way to Oldtown.” 
“Best send a raven to Lord Hightower and ask him to make certain your uncle does not take 
ship. We would hate for Garth to brave an autumn sea for nought.” She smiled pleasantly. 
A flush crept up Tyrell’s thick neck. “This... your lord father assured me...” He began to sputter. 
Then his mother appeared and slid her arm through his own. “It would seem that Lord Tywin 
did not share his plans with our regent, I can’t imagine why. Still, there ’tis, no use hectoring Her 
Grace. She is quite right, you must write Lord Leyton before Garth boards a ship. You know the 
sea will sicken him and make his farting worse.” Lady Olenna gave Cersei a toothless smile. 
“Your council chambers will smell sweeter with Lord Gyles, though I daresay that coughing 
would drive me to distraction. We all adore dear old uncle Garth, but the man is flatulent, that 
cannot be gainsaid. I do abhor foul smells.” Her wrinkled face wrinkled up even more. “I caught 
a whiff of something unpleasant in the holy sept, in truth. Mayhaps you smelled it too?” 
“No,” Cersei said coldly. “A scent, you say?” 
“More like a stink.” 
“Perhaps you miss your autumn roses. We have kept you here too long.” The sooner she rid the 
court of Lady Olenna the better. Lord Tyrell would doubtless dispatch a goodly number of 
knights to see his mother safely home, and the fewer Tyrell swords in the city, the more soundly 
the queen would sleep. 
“I do long for the fragrances of Highgarden, I confess it,” said the old lady, “but of course I 
cannot leave until I have seen my sweet Margaery wed to your
