A Clash of Kings 
Book Two of A song of Ice and Fire 
By George R. R. Martin 
PROLOGUE 
The comet's tail spread across the dawn, a red slash that bled above the crags of Dragonstone like a 
wound in the pink and purple sky. 
The maester stood on the windswept balcony outside his chambers. It was here the ravens came, after 
long flight. Their droppings speckled the gargoyles that rose twelve feet tall on either side of him, a 
hellhound and a wyvern, two of the thousand that brooded over the walls of the ancient fortress. When 
first he came to Dragonstone, the army of stone grotesques had made him uneasy, but as the years 
passed he had grown used to them. Now he thought of them as old friends. The three of them watched 
the sky together with foreboding. 
The maester did not believe in omens. And yet . . . old as he was, Cressen had never seen a comet half 
so bright, nor yet that color, that terrible color, the color of blood and flame and sunsets. He wondered if 
his gargoyles had ever seen its like. They had been here so much longer than he had, and would still be 
here long after he was gone. If stone tongues could speak . . . 
Such folly. He leaned against the battlement, the sea crashing beneath him, the black stone rough 
beneath his fingers. Talking gargoyles and prophecies in the sky. I am an old done man, grown giddy as a 
child again. Had a lifetime's hard-won wisdom fled him along with his health and strength? He was a 
maester, trained and chained in the great Citadel 
of Oldtown. What had he come to, when superstition filled his head as if he were an ignorant fieldhand? 
And yet . . . and yet . . . the comet burned even by day now, while pale grey steam rose from the hot 
vents of Dragonmont behind the castle, and yestermorn a white raven had brought word from the Citadel 
itself, word long-expected but no less fearful for all that, word of summer's end. Omens, all. Too many to 
deny. What does it all mean? he wanted to cry.

"Maester Cressen, we have visitors." Pylos spoke softly, as if loath to disturb Cressen's solemn 
meditations. Had he known what drivel filled his head, he would have shouted. "The princess would see 
the white raven." Ever correct, Pylos called her princess now, as her lord father was a king. King of a 
smoking rock in the great salt sea, yet a king nonetheless. "Her fool is with her." 
The old man turned away from the dawn, keeping a hand on his wyvern to steady himself. "Help me to 
my chair and show them in." 
Taking his arm, Pylos led him inside. In his youth, Cressen had walked briskly, but he was not far from 
his eightieth name day now, and his legs were frail and unsteady. Two years past, he had fallen and 
shattered a hip, and it had never mended properly. Last year when he took ill, the Citadel had sent Pylos 
out from Oldtown, mere days before Lord Stannis had closed the isle . . . to help him in his labors, it was 
said, but Cressen knew the truth. Pylos had come to replace him when he died. He did not mind. 
Someone must take his place, and sooner than he would like . . . 
He let the younger man settle him behind his books and papers. "Go bring her. It is ill to keep a lady 
waiting." He waved a hand, a feeble gesture of haste from a man no longer capable of hastening. His flesh 
was wrinkled and spotted, the skin so papery thin that he could see the web of veins and the shape of 
bones beneath. And how they trembled, these hands of his that had once been so sure and deft . . . 
When Pylos returned the girl came with him, shy as ever. Behind her, shuffling and hopping in that queer 
sideways walk of his, came her fool. On his head was a mock helm fashioned from an old tin bucket, 
with a rack of deer antlers strapped to the crown and hung with cowbells. With his every lurching step, 
the bells rang, each with a different voice, clang-a-dang bong-dong ring-a-ling clong clong clong. 
"Who comes to see us so early, Pylos?" Cressen said. 
"It's me and Patches, Maester." Guileless blue eyes blinked at him. Hers was not a pretty face, alas. The 
child had her lord father's square jut of jaw and her mother's unfortunate ears, along with a disfigurement 
all her own, the legacy of the bout of greyscale that had almost claimed her in the crib. Across half one 
cheek and well down her neck, her flesh was 
stiff and dead, the skin cracked and flaking, mottled black and grey and stony to the touch. "Pylos said 
we might see the white raven." 
"Indeed you may," Cressen answered. As if he would ever deny her. She had been denied too often in 
her time. Her name was Shireen. She would be ten on her next name day, and she was the saddest child 
that Maester Cressen had ever known. Her sadness is my shame, the old man thought, another mark of 
my failure. "Maester Pylos, do me a kindness and bring the bird down from the rookery for the Lady 
Shireen." 
"It would be my pleasure." Pylos was a polite youth, no more than five-and-twenty, yet solemn as a man 
of sixty. If only he had more humor, more life in him; that was what was needed here. Grim places 
needed lightening, not solemnity, and Dragonstone was grim beyond a doubt, a lonely citadel in the wet 
waste surrounded by storm and salt, with the smoking shadow of the mountain at its back. A maester 
must go where he is sent, so Cressen had come here with his lord some twelve years past, and he had 
served, and served well. Yet he had never loved Dragonstone, nor ever felt truly at home here. Of late, 
when he woke from restless dreams in which the red woman figured disturbingly, he often did not know 
where he was. 
Page 2

The fool turned his patched and piebald head to watch Pylos climb the steep iron steps to the rookery. 
His bells rang with the motion. "Under the sea, the birds have scales for feathers," he said, 
clang-a-langing. "I know, I know, oh, oh, oh." 
Even for a fool, Patchface was a sorry thing. Perhaps once he could evoke gales of laughter with a quip, 
but the sea had taken that power from him, along with half his wits and all his memory. He was soft and 
obese, subject to twitches and trembles, incoherent as often as not. The girl was the only one who 
laughed at him now, the only one who cared if he lived or died. 
An ugly little girl and a sad fool, and maester makes three . . . now there is a tale to make men weep. 
"Sit with me, child." Cressen beckoned her closer. "This is early to come calling, scarce past dawn. You 
should be snug in your bed." 
"I had bad dreams," Shireen told him. "About the dragons. They were coming to eat me." 
The child had been plagued by nightmares as far back as Maester Cressen could recall. "We have 
talked of this before," he said gently. "The dragons cannot come to life. They are carved of stone, child. 
In olden days, our island was the westernmost outpost of the great Freehold of Valyria. It was the 
Valyrians who raised this citadel, and they had ways of shaping stone since lost to us. A castle must have 
towers wherever two walls meet at an angle, for defense. The Valyrians fashioned these towers in the 
shape of dragons to make their fortress seem more fearsome, 
just as they crowned their walls with a thousand gargoyles instead of simple crenellations." He 
took her small pink hand in his own frail spotted one and gave it a gentle squeeze. "So you see, there is 
nothing to fear. " 
Shireen was unconvinced. "What about the thing in the sky? Dalla and Matrice were talking by the well, 
and Dalla said she heard the red woman tell Mother that it was dragonshreath. If the dragons are 
breathing, doesn't that mean they are coming to life?" 
The red woman, Maester Cressen thought sourly.Illenough that she's filled the head of the mother with 
her madness, must she poison the daughter's dreams as well? He would have a stern word with Dalla, 
warn her not to spread such tales. "The thing in the sky is a comet, sweet child. A star with a tail, lost in 
the heavens. It will be gone soon enough, never to be seen again in our lifetimes. Watch and see." 
Shireen gave a brave little nod. "Mother said the white raven means it's not summer anymore." 
"That is so, my lady. The white ravens fly only from the Citadel." Cressen's fingers went to the chain 
about his neck, each link forged from a different metal, each symbolizing his mastery of another branch of 
learning; the maester's collar, mark of his order. In the pride of his youth, he had worn it easily, but now it 
seemed heavy to him, the metal cold against his skin. "They are larger than other ravens, and more clever, 
bred to carry only the most important messages. This one came to tell us that the Conclave has met, 
considered the reports and measurements made by maesters all over the realm, and declared this great 
summer done at last. Ten years, two turns, and sixteen days it lasted, the longest summer in living 
memory." 
"Will it get cold now?" Shireen was a summer child, and had never known true cold. 
"In time," Cressen replied. "If the gods are good, they will grant us a warm autumn and bountiful 
harvests, so we might prepare for the winter to come." The smallfolk said that a long summer meant an 
even longer winter, but the maester saw no reason to frighten the child with such tales. 
Page 3

Patchface rang his bells. "It is always summer under the sea," he intoned. "The merwives wear 
nennymoans in their hair and weave gowns of silver seaweed. I know, I know, oh, oh, oh." 
Shireen giggled. "I should like a gown of silver seaweed." 
"Under the sea, it snows up," said the fool, "and the rain is dry as bone. I know, I know, oh, oh, oh." 
"Will it truly snow?" the child asked. 
"It will," Cressen said. But not for years yet, I pray, and then not for long. "Ah, here is Pylos with the 
bird." 
Shireen gave a cry of delight. Even Cressen had to admit the bird made an impressive sight, white as 
snow and larger than any hawk, with the bright black eyes that meant it was no mere albino, but a 
truebred white raven of the Citadel. "Here," he called. The raven spread its wings, leapt into the air, and 
flapped noisily across the room to land on the table beside him. 
"I'll see to your breakfast now," Pylos announced. Cressen nodded. "This is the Lady Shireen," he told 
the raven. The bird bobbed its pale head up and down, as if it were bowing. "Lady," it croaked. "Lady." 
The child's mouth gaped open. "It talks!" 
"A few words. As I said, they are clever, these birds." 
"Clever bird, clever man, clever clever fool," said Patchface, jangling. "Oh, clever clever clever fool." He 
began to sing. "The shadows come to dance, my lord, dance my lord, dance my lord," he sang, hopping 
from one foot to the other and back again. "The shadows come to stay, my lord, stay my lord, stay my 
lord. " He jerked his head with each word, the bells in his antlers sending up a clangor. 
The white raven screamed and went flapping away to perch on the iron railing of the rookery stairs. 
Shireen seemed to grow smaller. "He sings that all the time. I told him to stop but he won't. It makes me 
scared. Make him stop." 
And how do I do that? the old man wondered. Once I might have silenced him forever, but now . . . 
Patchface had come to them as a boy. Lord Steffon of cherished memory had found him in Volantis, 
across the narrow sea. The king-the old king, Aerys II Targaryen, who had not been quite so mad in 
those dayshad sent his lordship to seek a bride for Prince Rhaegar, who had no sisters to wed. "We have 
found the most splendid fool," he wrote Cressen, a fortnight before he was to return home from his 
fruitless mission. "Only a boy, yet nimble as a monkey and witty as a dozen courtiers. He juggles and 
riddles and does magic, and he can sing prettily in four tongues. We have bought his freedom and hope 
to bring him home with us. Robert will be delighted with him, and perhaps in time he will even teach 
Stannis how to laugh." 
It saddened Cressen to remember that letter. No one had ever taught Stannis how to laugh, least of all 
the boy Patchface. The storm came up suddenly, howling, and Shipbreaker Bay proved the truth of its 
name. The lord's two-masted galley Windproud broke up within sight of his castle. From its parapets his 
two eldest sons had watched as their father's ship was smashed against the rocks and swallowed by the 
waters. A hundred oarsmen and sailors went down with Lord Steffon Baratheon and his lady wife, and 
for days thereafter every tide left a fresh crop of swollen corpses on the strand below Storm's End. 
Page 4

The boy washed up on the third day. Maester Cressen had come down with the rest, to help put names 
to the dead. When they found the fool he was naked, his skin white and wrinkled and powdered with 
wet sand. Cressen had thought him another corpse, but when Jornmy grabbed his ankles to drag him off 
to the burial wagon, the boy coughed water and sat up. To his dying day, Jornmy had sworn that 
Patchface's flesh was clammy cold. 
No one ever explained those two days the fool had been lost in the sea. The fisherfolk liked to say a 
mermaid had taught him to breathe water in return for his seed. Patchface himself had said nothing. The 
witty, clever lad that Lord Steffon had written of never reached Storm's End; the boy they found was 
someone else, broken in body and mind, hardly capable of speech, much less of wit. Yet his fool's face 
left no doubt of who he was. It was the fashion in the Free City of Volantis to tattoo the faces of slaves 
and servants; from neck to scalp the boy's skin had been patterned in squares of red and green motley. 
"The wretch is mad, and in pain, and no use to anyone, least of all himself," declared old Ser Harbert, 
the castellan of Storm's End in those years. "The kindest thing you could do for that one is fill his cup with 
the milk of the poppy. A painless sleep, and there's an end to it. He'd bless you if he had the wit for it." 
But Cressen had refused, and in the end he had won. Whether Patchface had gotten any joy of that 
victory he could not say, not even today, so many years later. 
"The shadows come to dance, my lord, dance my lord, dance my lord " the fool sang on, swinging his 
head and making his bells clang and clatter. Bong dong, ring-a-ling, bong dong. 
"Lord," the white raven shrieked. "Lord, lord, lord." 
"A fool sings what he will," the maester told his anxious princess. "You must not take his words to heart. 
On the morrow he may remember another song, and this one will never be heard again." He can sing 
prettily in four tongues, Lord Steffon had written . . . 
Pylos strode through the door. "Maester, pardons." 
"You have forgotten the porridge," Cressen said, amused. That was most unlike Pylos. 
"Maester, Ser Davos returned last night. They were talking of it in the kitchen. I thought you would want 
to know at once." 
"Davos . . . last night, you say? Where is he?" 
"With the king. They have been together most of the night." 
There was a time when Lord Stannis would have woken him, no matter the hour, to have him there to 
give his counsel. "I should have been told," Cressen complained. "I should have been woken." He 
disentangled his fingers from Shireen's. "Pardons, my lady, but I must speak with your lord father. Pylos, 
give me your arm. There are too many steps in 
this castle, and it seems to me they add a few every night, just to vex me. 
Shireen and Patchface followed them out, but the child soon grew restless with the old man's creeping 
pace and dashed ahead, the fool lurching after her with his cowbells clanging madly. 
Castles are not friendly places for the frail, Cressen was reminded as he descended the turnpike stairs of 
Page 5

Sea Dragon Tower. Lord Stannis would be found in the Chamber of the Painted Table, atop the Stone 
Drum, Dragonstone's central keep, so named for the way its ancient walls boomed and rumbled during 
storms. To reach him they must cross the gallery, pass through the middle and inner walls with their 
guardian gargoyles and black iron gates, and ascend more steps than Cressen cared to contemplate. 
Young men climbed steps two at a time; for old men with bad hips, every one was a torment. But Lord 
Stannis would not think to come to him, so the maester resigned himself to the ordeal. He had Pylos to 
help him, at the least, and for that he was grateful. 
Shuffling along the gallery, they passed before a row of tall arched windows with commanding views of 
the outer bailey, the curtain wall, and the fishing village beyond. in the yard, archers were firing at practice 
butts to the call of "Notch, draw, loose." Their arrows made a sound like a flock of birds taking wing. 
Guardsmen strode the wallwalks, peering between the gargoyles on the host camped without. The 
morning air was hazy with the smoke of cookfires, as three thousand men sat down to break their fasts 
beneath the banners of their lords. Past the sprawl of the camp, the anchorage was crowded with ships. 
No craft that had come within sight of Dragonstone this past half year had been allowed to leave again. 
Lord Stannis's Fury, a triple-decked war galley of three hundred oars, looked almost small beside some 
of the big-bellied carracks and cogs that surrounded her. 
The guardsmen outside the Stone Drum knew the maesters by sight, and passed them through. "Wait 
here," Cressen told Pylos, within. "It's best I see him alone." 
"It is a long climb, Maester." 
Cressen smiled. "You think I have forgotten? I have climbed these steps so often I know each one by 
name." 
Halfway up, he regretted his decision. He had stopped to catch his breath and ease the pain in his hip 
when he heard the scuff of boots on stone, and came face-to-face with Ser Davos Seaworth, 
descending. 
Davos was a slight man, his low birth written plain upon a common face. A well-worn green cloak, 
stained by salt and spray and faded from the sun, draped his thin shoulders, over brown doublet and 
breeches that matched brown eyes and hair. About his neck a pouch of worn leather hung from a thong. 
His small beard was well peppered with grey, and he 
wore a leather glove on his maimed left hand. When he saw Cressen, he checked his descent. 
"Ser Davos," the maester said. "When did you return?" 
"In the black of morning. My favorite time." It was said that no one had ever handled a ship by night half 
so well as Davos Shorthand. Before Lord Stannis had knighted him, he had been the most notorious and 
elusive smuggler in all the Seven Kingdoms. 
"And?" 
The man shook his head. "It is as you warned him. They will not rise, Maester. Not for him. They do not 
love him." 
No, Cressen thought. Nor will they ever. He is strong, able, just . . . aye, just past the point of wisdom . 
. . yet it is not enough. It has never been enough. "You spoke to them all?" 
Page 6

"All? No. Only those that would see me. They do not love me either, these highborns. To them I'll 
always be the Onion Knight." His left hand closed, stubby fingers locking into a fist; Stannis had hacked 
the ends off at the last joint, all but the thumb. "I broke bread with Gulian Swann and old Penrose, and 
the Tarths consented to a midnight meeting in a grove. The others-well, Beric Dondarrion is gone missing, 
some say dead, and Lord Caron is with Renly. Bryce the Orange, of the Rainbow Guard." 
"The Rainbow Guard?" 
"Renly's made his own Kingsguard," the onetime smuggler explained, "but these seven don't wear white. 
Each one has his own color. Loras Tyrell's their Lord Commander." 
It was just the sort of notion that would appeal to Renly Baratheon; a splendid new order of knighthood, 
with gorgeous new raiment to proclaim it. Even as a boy, Renly had loved bright colors and rich fabrics, 
and he had loved his games as well. "Look at me!" he would shout as he ran laughing through the halls of 
Storm's End. "Look at me, I'm a dragon," or "Look at me, I'm a wizard," or "Look at me, look at me, 
I'm the rain god." 
The bold little boy with wild black hair and laughing eyes was a man grown now, one-and-twenty, and 
still he played his games. Look at me, I'm a king, Cressen thought sadly. Oh, Renly, Renly, dear sweet 
child, do you know what you are doing~ And would you care if you did? is there anyone who cares for 
him but me~ "What reasons did the lords give for their refusals?" he asked Ser Davos. 
"Well, as to that, some gave me soft words and some blunt, some made excuses, some promises, some 
only lied." He shrugged. "In the end words are just wind." 
"You could bring him no hope?" 
"Only the false sort, and I'd not do that," Davos said. "He had the truth from me." 
Maester Cressen remembered the day Davos had been knighted, after the siege of Storm's End. Lord 
Stannis and a small garrison had held the castle for close to a year, against the great host of the Lords 
Tyrell and Redwyne. Even the sea was closed against them, watched day and night by Redwyne galleys 
flying the burgundy banners of the Arbor. Within Storm's End, the horses had long since been eaten, the 
dogs and cats were gone, and the garrison was down to roots and rats. Then came a night when the 
moon was new and black clouds hid the stars. Cloaked in that darkness, Davos the smuggler had dared 
the Redwyne cordon and the rocks of Shipbreaker Bay alike. His little ship had a black hull, black sails, 
black oars, and a hold crammed with onions and salt fish. Little enough, yet it had kept the garrison alive 
long enough for Eddard Stark to reach Storm's End and break the siege. 
Lord Stannis had rewarded Davos with choice lands on Cape Wrath, a small keep, and a knight's 
honors . . . but he had also decreed that he lose a joint of each finger on his left hand, to pay for all his 
years of smuggling. Davos had submitted, on the condition that Stannis wield the knife himself; he would 
accept no punishment from lesser hands. The lord had used a butcher's cleaver, the better to cut clean 
and true. Afterward, Davos had chosen the name Seaworth for his new-made house, and he took for his 
banner a black ship on a pale grey field-with an onion on its sails. The onetime smuggler was fond of 
saying that Lord Stannis had done him a boon, by giving him four less fingernails to clean and trim. 
No, Cressen thought, a man like that would give no false hope, nor soften a hard truth. "Ser Davos, truth 
can be a bitter draught, even for a man like Lord Stannis. He thinks only of returning to King's Landing in 
the fullness of his power, to tear down his enemies and claim what is rightfully his. Yet now . . ." 
Page 7

"if he takes this meager host to King's Landing, it will be only to die. He does not have the numbers. I 
told him as much, but you know his pride." Davos held up his gloved hand. "My fingers will grow back 
before that man bends to sense." 
The old man sighed. "You have done all you could. Now I must add my voice to yours." Wearily, he 
resumed his climb. 
Lord Stannis Baratheon's refuge was a great round room with walls of bare black stone and four tall 
narrow windows that looked out to the four points of the compass. In the center of the chamber was the 
great table from which it took its name, a massive slab of carved wood fashioned at the command of 
Aegon Targaryen in the days before the Conquest. 
The Painted Table was more than fifty feet long, perhaps half that wide at its widest point, but less 
than four feet across at its narrowest. Aegon's carpenters had shaped it after the land of Westeros, 
sawing out each bay and peninsula until the table nowhere ran straight. On its surface, darkened by near 
three hundred years of varnish, were painted the Seven Kingdoms as they had been in Aegon's day; 
rivers and mountains, castles and cities, lakes and forests. 
There was a single chair in the room, carefully positioned in the precise place that Dragonstone occupied 
off the coast of Westeros, and raised up to give a good view of the tabletop. Seated in the chair was a 
man in a tight-laced leather jerkin and breeches of roughspun brown wool. When Maester Cressen 
entered, he glanced up. "I knew you would come, old man, whether I summoned you or no." There was 
no hint of warmth in his voice; there seldom was. 
Stannis Baratheon, Lord of Dragonstone and by the grace of the gods rightful heir to the Iron Throne of 
the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, was broad of shoulder and sinewy of limb, with a tightness to his face 
and flesh that spoke of leather cured in the sun until it was as tough as steel. Hard was the word men 
used when they spoke of Stannis, and hard he was. Though he was not yet five-and-thirty, only a fringe 
of thin black hair remained on his head, circling behind his ears like the shadow of a crown. His brother, 
the late King Robert, had grown a beard in his final years. Maester Cressen had never seen it, but they 
said it was a wild thing, thick and flerce. As if in answer, Stannis kept his own whiskers cropped tight and 
short. They lay like a blue-black shadow across his square jaw and the bony hollows of his cheeks. His 
eyes were open wounds beneath his heavy brows, a blue as dark as the sea by night. His mouth would 
have given despair to even the drollest of fools; it was a mouth made for frowns and scowls and sharply 
worded commands, all thin pale lips and clenched muscles, a mouth that had forgotten how to smile and 
had never known how to laugh. Sometimes when the world grew very still and silent of a night, Maester 
Cressen fancied he could hear Lord Stannis grinding his teeth half a castle away. 
"Once you would have woken me," the old man said. 
"Once you were young. Now you are old and sick, and need your sleep." Stannis had never learned to 
soften his speech, to dissemble or flatter; he said what he thought, and those that did not like it could be 
damned. "I knew you'd learn what Davos had to say soon enough. You always do, don't you?" 
"I would be of no help to you if I did not," Cressen said. "I met Davos on the stair." 
"And he told all, I suppose? I should have had the man's tongue shortened along with his fingers." 
"He would have made you a poor envoy then." 
"He made me a poor envoy in any case. The storm lords will not rise for me. It seems they do not like 
Page 8

me, and the justice of my cause means nothing to them. The cravenly ones will sit behind their walls 
waiting to see how the wind rises and who is likely to triumph. The bold ones have already declared for 
Renly. For R enly! " He spat out the name like poison on his tongue. 
"Your brother has been the Lord of Storm's End these past thirteen years. These lords are his sworn 
bannermen-" 
"His, " Stannis broke in, "when by rights they should be mine. I never asked for Dragonstone. I never 
wanted it. I took it because Robert's enemies were here and he commanded me to root them out. I built 
his fleet and did his work, dutiful as a younger brother should be to an elder, as Renly should be to me. 
And what was Robert's thanks? He names me Lord of Dragonstone, and gives Storm's End and its 
incomes to Renly. Storm's End belonged to House Baratheon for three hundred years; by rights it should 
have passed to me when Robert took the Iron Throne." 
It was an old grievance, deeply felt, and never more so than now. Here was the heart of his lord's 
weakness; for Dragonstone, old and strong though it was, commanded the allegiance of only a handful of 
lesser lords, whose stony island holdings were too thinly peopled to yield up the men that Stannis needed. 
Even with the sellswords he had brought across the narrow sea from the Free Cities of Myr and Lys, the 
host camped outside his walls was far too small to bring down the power of House Lannister. 
"Robert did you an injustice," Maester Cressen replied carefully, "yet he had sound reasons. 
Dragonstone had long been the seat of House Targaryen. He needed a man's strength to rule here, and 
Renly was but a child." 
"He is a child still," Stannis declared, his anger ringing loud in the empty hall, "a thieving child who thinks 
to snatch the crown off my brow. What has Renly ever done to earn a throne? He sits in council and jests 
with Littlefinger, and at tourneys he dons his splendid suit of armor and allows himself to be knocked off 
his horse by a better man. That is the sum of my brother Renly, who thinks he ought to be a king. I ask 
you, why did the gods inflict me with brothers?" 
"I cannot answer for the gods." 
"You seldom answer at all these days, it seems to me. Who maesters for Renly? Perchance I should 
send for him, I might like his counsel better. What do you think this maester said when my brother 
decided to steal my crown? What counsel did your colleague offer to this traitor blood of mine?" 
"It would surprise me if Lord Renly sought counsel, Your Grace." The 
youngest of Lord Steffon's three sons had grown into a man bold but heedless, who acted from impulse 
rather than calculation. In that, as in so much else, Renly was like his brother Robert, and utterly unlike 
Stannis. 
"Your Grace," Stannis repeated bitterly. "You mock me with a king's style, yet what am I king of? 
Dragonstone and a few rocks in the narrow sea, there is my kingdom." He descended the steps of his 
chair to stand before the table, his shadow falling across the mouth of the Blackwater Rush and the 
painted forest where King's Landing now stood. There he stood, brooding over the realm he sought to 
claim, so near at hand and yet so far away. "Tonight I am to sup with my lords bannermen, such as they 
are. Celtigar, Velaryon, Bar Emmon, the whole paltry lot of them. A poor crop, if truth be told, but they 
are what my brothers have left me. That Lysene pirate Salladhor Saan will be there with the latest tally of 
what I owe him, and Morosh the Myrman will caution me with talk of tides and autumn gales, while Lord 
Sunglass mutters piously of the will of the Seven. Celtigar will want to know which storm lords are joining 
Page 9

us. Velaryon will threaten to take his levies home unless we strike at once. What am I to tell them? What 
must I do now?" 
"Your true enemies are the Lannisters, my lord," Maester Cressen answered. "If you and your brother 
were to make common cause against them-" 
"I will not treat with Renly," Stannis answered in a tone that brooked no argument. "Not while he calls 
himself a king." 
"Not Renly, then," the maester yielded. His lord was stubborn and proud; when he had set his mind, 
there was no changing it. "Others might serve your needs as well. Eddard Stark's son has been 
proclaimed King in the North, with all the power of Winterfell and Riverrun behind him." 
"A green boy," said Stannis, "and another false king. Am I to accept a broken realm?" 
"Surely half a kingdom is better than none," Cressen said, "and if you help the boy avenge his father's 
murder-" 
"Why should I avenge Eddard Stark? The man was nothing to me. Oh, Robert loved him, to be sure. 
Loved him as a brother, how often did I hear that? I was his brother, not Ned Stark, but you would 
never have known it by the way he treated me. I held Storm's End for him, watching good men starve 
while Mace Tyrell and Paxter Redwyne feasted within sight of my walls. Did Robert thank me? No. He 
thanked Stark, for lifting the siege when we were down to rats and radishes. I built a fleet at Robert's 
command, took Dragonstone in his name. Did he take my hand and say, Well done, brother, whatever 
should I do without you? No, he blamed me for letting Willem Darry steal away Viserys and the babe, as 
if I could have stopped it. I sat on his council for fifteen years, helping Jon Arryn rule his realm while 
Robert drank and whored, but when Jon died, did my brother name me his Hand? No, he went galloping 
off to his dear friend Ned Stark, and offered him the honor. And small good it did either of them. " 
"Be that as it may, my lord," Maester Cressen said gently. "Great wrongs have been done you, but the 
past is dust. The future may yet be won if you join with the Starks. There are others you might sound out 
as well. What of Lady Arryn? If the queen murdered her husband, surely she will want justice for him. 
She has a young son, Jon Arryn's heir. If you were to betroth Shireen to him-" 
"The boy is weak and sickly," Lord Stannis objected. "Even his father saw how it was, when he asked 
me to foster him on Dragonstone. Service as a page might have done him good, but that damnable 
Lannister woman had Lord Arryn poisoned before it could be done, and now Lysa hides him in the 
Eyrie. She'll never part with the boy, I promise you that. " 
"Then you must send Shireen to the Eyrie," the maester ' urged. "Dragonstone is a grim home for a child. 
Let her fool go with her, so she will have a familiar face about her." 
"Familiar and hideous." Stannis furrowed his brow in thought. "Still . . . perhaps it is worth the trying . . . 
"Must the rightful Lord of the Seven Kingdoms beg for help from widow women and usurpers?" a 
woman's voice asked sharply. 
Maester Cressen turned ' and bowed his head. "My lady," he said, chagrined that he had not heard her 
enter. 
Page 10

Lord Stannis scowled. "I do not beg. Of anyone. Mind you remember that, woman." 
"I am pleased to hear it, my lord." Lady Selyse was as tall as her husband, thin of body and thin of face, 
with prominent ears, a sharp nose, and the faintest hint of a mustache on her upper lip. She plucked it 
daily and cursed it regularly, yet it never failed to return. Her eyes were pale, her mouth stern, her voice a 
whip. She cracked it now. "Lady Arryn owes you her allegiance, as do the Starks, your brother Renly, 
and all the rest. You are their one true king. It would not be fitting to plead and bargain with them for 
what is rightfully yours by the grace of god." 
God, she said, not gods. The red woman had won her, heart and soul, turning her from the gods of the 
Seven Kingdoms, both old and new, to worship the one they called the Lord of Light. 
"Your god can keep his grace," said Lord Stannis, who did not share his wife's fervent new faith. "It's 
swords I need, not blessings. Do you have an army hidden somewhere that you've not told me of?" 
There was' no affection in his tone. Stannis had always been uncomfortable around 
women, even his own wife. When he had gone to King's Landing to sit on Robert's council, he had left 
Selyse on Dragonstone with their daughter. His letters had been few, his visits fewer; he did his duty in 
the marriage bed once or twice a year, but took no joy in it, and the sons he had once hoped for had 
never come. 
"My brothers and uncles and cousins have armies," she told him. "House Florent will rally to your 
banner." 
"House Florent can field two thousand swords at best." It was said that Stannis knew the strength of 
every house in the Seven Kingdoms. "And you have a deal more faith in your brothers and uncles than I 
do, my lady. The Florent lands lie too close to Highgarden for your lord uncle to risk Mace Tyrell's 
wrath." 
"There is another way." Lady Selyse moved closer. "Look out your windows, my lord. There is the sign 
you have waited for, blazoned on the sky. Red, it is, the red of flame, red for the fiery heart of the true 
god. it is his banner-and yours! See how it unfurls across the heavens like a dragon's hot breath, and you 
the Lord of Dragonstone. It means your time has come, Your Grace. Nothing is more certain. You are 
meant to sail from this desolate rock as Aegon the Conqueror once sailed, to sweep all before you as he 
did. only say the word, and embrace the power of the Lord of Light." 
"How many swords will the Lord of Light put into my hand?" Stannis demanded again. 
"All you need," his wife promised, "The swords of Storm's End and Highgarden for a start, and all their 
lords bannermen." 
"Davos would tell you different," Stannis said. "Those swords are sworn to Renly. They love my 
charming young brother, as they once loved Robert . . . and as they have never loved me." 
"Yes," she answered, "but if Renly should die . . ." 
Stannis looked at his lady with narrowed eyes, until Cressen could not hold his tongue. "it is not to be 
thought. Your Grace, whatever follies Renly has committed-" 
"Follies? I call them treasons." Stannis turned back to his wife. "My brother is young and strong, and he 
has a vast host around him, and these rainbow knights of his." 
Page 11

"Melisandre has gazed into the flames, and seen him dead." 
Cressen was horrorstruck. "Fratricide . . . my lord, this is evil, unthinkable . . . please, listen to me." 
Lady Selyse gave him a measured look. "And what will you tell him, Maester? How he might win half a 
kingdom if he goes to the Starks on his knees and sells our daughter to Lysa Arryn?" 
"I have heard your counsel, Cressen," Lord Stannis said. "Now I will hear hers. You are dismissed." 
Maester Cressen bent a stiff knee. He could feel Lady Selyse's eyes on his back as he shuffled slowly 
across the room. By the time he reached the bottom of the steps it was all he could do to stand erect. 
"Help me," he said to Pylos. 
When he was safe back in his own rooms, Cressen sent the younger man away and limped to his 
balcony once more, to stand between his gargoyles and stare out to sea. One of Salladhor Saan's 
warships was sweeping past the castle, her gaily striped hull slicing through the greygreen waters as her 
oars rose and fell. He watched until she vanished behind a headland. Would that my fears could vanish so 
easily. Had he lived so long for this? 
When a maester donned his collar, he put aside the hope of children, yet Cressen had oft felt a father 
nonetheless. Robert, Stannis, Renly . . . three sons he had raised after the angry sea claimed Lord 
Steffon. Had he done so ill that now he must watch one kill the other? He could not allow it, would not 
allow it. 
The woman was the heart of it. Not the Lady Selyse, the other one. The red woman, the servants had 
named her, afraid to speak her name. "I will speak her name," Cressen told his stone hellhound. 
"Melisandre. Her." Melisandre of Asshai, sorceress, shadowbinder, and priestess to R'hllor, the Lord of 
Light, the Heart of Fire, the God of Flame and Shadow. Melisandre, whose madness must not be 
allowed to spread beyond Dragonstone. 
His chambers seemed dim and gloomy after the brightness of the morning. With fumbling hands, the old 
man lit a candle and carried it to the workroom beneath the rookery stair, where his ointments, potions, 
and medicines stood neatly on their shelves. On the bottom shelf behind a row of salves in squat clay jars 
he found a vial of indigo glass, no larger than his little finger. It rattled when he shook it. Cressen blew 
away a layer of dust and carried it back to his table. Collapsing into his chair, he pulled the stopper and 
spilled out the vial's contents. A dozen crystals, no larger than seeds, rattled across the parchment he'd 
been reading. They shone like jewels in the candlelight, so purple that the maester found himself thinking 
that he had never truly seen the color before. 
The chain around his throat felt very heavy. He touched one of the crystals lightly with the tip of his little 
finger. Such a small thing to hold the power of life and death. It was made from a certain plant that grew 
only on the islands of the Jade Sea, half a world away. The leaves had to be aged, and soaked in a wash 
of limes and sugar water and certain rare spices from the Summer Isles. Afterward they could be 
discarded, but the potion must be thickened with ash and allowed to crystallize. The process was slow 
and difficult, the necessaries costly and hard to acquire. The alchemists of Lys knew the way of it, 
though, and the Faceless Men 
of Braavos . . . and the maesters of his order as well, though it was not something talked about beyond 
the walls of the Citadel. All the world knew that a maester forged his silver link when he learned the art of 
healing-but the world preferred to forget that men who knew how to heal also knew how to kill. 
Page 12

Cressen no longer recalled the name the Asshai'i gave the leaf, or the Lysene poisoners the crystal. In 
the Citadel, it was simply called the strangler. Dissolved in wine, it would make the muscles of a man's 
throat clench tighter than any fist, shutting off his windpipe. They said a victim's face turned as purple as 
the little crystal seed from which his death was grown, but so too did a man choking on a morsel of food. 
And this very night Lord Stannis would feast his bannermen, his lady wife . . . and the red woman, 
Melisandre of Asshai. 
I must rest, Maester Cressen told himself. I must have all my strength come dark. My hands must not 
shake, nor my courage flag. It is a dreadful thing I do, yet it must be done. If there are gods, surely they 
will forgive me. He had slept so poorly of late. A nap would refresh him for the ordeal ahead. Wearily, he 
tottered off to his bed. Yet when he closed his eyes, he could still see the light of the comet, red and flery 
and vividly alive amidst the darkness of his dreams. Perhaps it is my comet, he thought drowsily at the 
last, just before sleep took him. An omen of blood, foretelling murder . . . yes . . . 
When he woke it was full dark, his bedchamber was black, and every joint in his body ached. Cressen 
pushed himself up, his head throbbing. Clutching for his cane, he rose unsteady to his feet. So late, he 
thought. They did not summon me. He was always summoned for feasts, seated near the salt, close to 
Lord Stannis. His lord's face swam up before him, not the man he was but the boy he had been, standing 
cold in the shadows while the sun shone on his elder brother. Whatever he did, Robert had done first, 
and better. Poor boy . . . he must hurry, for his sake. 
The maester found the crystals where he had left them, and scooped them off the parchment. Cressen 
owned no hollow rings, such as the poisoners of Lys were said to favor, but a myriad of pockets great 
and small were sewn inside the loose sleeves of his robe. He secreted the strangler seeds in one of them, 
threw open his door, and called, "Pylos? Where are you?" When he heard no reply, he called again, 
louder. "Pylos, I need help." Still there came no answer. That was queer; the young maester had his cell 
only a half turn down the stair, within easy earshot. 
In the end, Cressen had to shout for the servants. "Make haste," he told them. "I have slept too long. 
They will be feasting by now . . . drinking . . . I should have been woken." What had happened to 
Maester Pylos? Truly, he did not understand. 
Again he had to cross the long gallery. A night wind whispered 
through the great windows, sharp with the smell of the sea. Torches flickered along the walls of 
Dragonstone, and in the camp beyond, he could see hundreds of cookfires burning, as if a field of stars 
had fallen to the earth. Above, the comet blazed red and malevolent. I am too old and wise to fear such 
things, the maester told himself. 
The doors to the Great Hall were set in the mouth of a stone dragon. He told the servants to leave him 
outside. It would be better to enter alone; he must not appear feeble. Leaning heavily on his cane, 
Cressen climbed the last few steps and hobbled beneath the gateway teeth. A pair of guardsmen opened 
the heavy red doors before him, unleashing a sudden blast of noise and light. Cressen stepped down into 
the dragon's maw. 
over the clatter of knife and plate and the low mutter of table talk, he heard Patchface singing, ". . . 
dance, my lord, dance my lord," to the accompaniment of jangling cowbells. The same dreadful song he'd 
sung this morning. "The shadows come to stay, my lord, stay my lord, stay my lord. " The lower tables 
were crowded with knights, archers, and sellsword captains, tearing apart loaves of black bread to soak 
Page 13

in their fish stew. Here there was no loud laughter, no raucous shouting such as marred the dignity of 
other men's feasts; Lord Stannis did not permit such. 
Cressen made his way toward the raised platform where the lords sat with the king. He had to step wide 
around Patchface. Dancing, his bells ringing, the fool neither saw nor heard his approach. As he hopped 
from one leg to the other, Patchface lurched into Cressen, knocking his cane out from under him. They 
went crashing down together amidst the rushes in a tangle of arms and legs, while a sudden gale of 
laughter went up around them. No doubt it was a comical sight. 
Patchface sprawled half on top of him, motley fool's face pressed close to his own. He had lost his tin 
helm with its antlers and bells. "Under the sea, you fall up," he declared. "I know, I know, oh, oh, oh. " 
Giggling, the fool rolled off, bounded to his feet, and did a little dance. 
Trying to make the best of it, the maester smiled feebly and struggled to rise, but his hip was in such pain 
that for a moment he was half afraid that he had broken it all over again. He felt strong hands grasp him 
under the arms and lift him back to his feet. "Thank you, ser," he murmured, turning to see which knight 
had come to his aid . . . 
"Maester," said Lady Melisandre, her deep voice flavored with the music of the jade Sea. "You ought 
take more care." As ever, she wore red head to heel, a long loose gown of flowing silk as bright as fire, 
with dagged sleeves and deep slashes in the bodice that showed glimpses of a darker bloodred fabric 
beneath. Around her throat was a red gold choker tighter than any maester's chain, ornamented with a 
single great ruby. 
Her hair was not the orange or strawberry color of common red-haired men, but a deep burnished 
copper that shone in the light of the torches. Even her eyes were red . . . but her skin was smooth and 
white, unblemished, pale as cream. Slender she was, graceful, taller than most knights, with full breasts 
and narrow waist and a heart-shaped face. Men's eyes that once found her did not quickly look away, 
not even a maester's eyes. Many called her beautiful. She was not beautiful. She was red, and terrible, 
and red. 
"I . . . thank you, my lady." 
"A man your age must look to where he steps," Melisandre said courteously. "The night is dark and full 
of terrors." 
He knew the phrase, some prayer of her faith. It makes no matter, I have a faith of my own. "Only 
children fear the dark," he told her. Yet even as he said the words, he heard Patchface take up his song 
again. "The shadows come to dance, my lord, dance my lord, dance my lord. " 
"Now here is a riddle," Melisandre said. "A clever fool and a foolish wise man." Bending, she picked up 
Patchface's helm from where it had fallen and set it on Cressen's head. The cowbells rang softly as the tin 
bucket slid down over his ears. "A crown to match your chain, Lord Maester," she announced. All 
around them, men were laughing. 
Cressen pressed his lips together and fought to still his rage. She thought he was feeble and helpless, but 
she would learn otherwise before the night was done. Old he might be, yet he was still a maester of the 
Citadel. "I need no crown but truth," he told her, removing the fool's helm from his head. 
"There are truths in this world that are not taught at Oldtown." Melisandre turned from him in a swirl of 
red silk and made her way back to the high table, where King Stannis and his queen were seated. 
Page 14

Cressen handed the antlered tin bucket back to Patchface, and made to follow. 
Maester Pylos sat in his place. 
The old man could only stop and stare. "Maester Pylos," he said at last. "You . . . you did not wake me." 
"His Grace commanded me to let you rest." Pylos had at least the grace to blush. "He told me you were 
not needed here." 
Cressen looked over the knights and captains and lords sitting silent. Lord Celtigar, aged and sour, wore 
a mantle patterned with red crabs picked out in garnets. Handsome Lord Velaryon chose sea-green silk, 
the white gold seahorse at his throat matching his long fair hair. Lord Bar Emmon, that plump boy of 
fourteen, was swathed in purple velvet trimmed with white seal, Ser Axell Florent remained homely even 
in russet and fox fur, pious Lord Sunglass wore moonstones at throat and wrist and finger, and the 
Lysene captain Salladhor Saan was a sunburst of scarlet satin, gold, and jewels. Only Ser Davos dressed 
simply, in brown 
doublet and green wool mantle, and only Ser Davos met his gaze, with pity in his eyes. 
"You are too ill and too confused to be of use to me, old man." It sounded so like Lord Stannis's voice, 
but it could not be, it could not. "Pylos will counsel me henceforth. Already he works with the ravens, 
since you can no longer climb to the rookery. I will not have you kill yourself in my service." 
Maester Cressen blinked. Stannis, my lord, my sad sullen boy, son I never had, you must not do this, 
don't you know how I have cared for you, lived for you, loved you despite all? Yes, loved you, better 
than Robert even, or Renly, for you were the one unloved, the one who needed me most. Yet all he said 
was, "As you command, my lord, but . . . but I am hungry. Might not I have a place at your table?" At 
your side, I belong at your side . . . 
Ser Davos rose from the bench. "I should be honored if the maester would sit here beside me, Your 
Grace." 
"As you will." Lord Stannis turned away to say something to Melisandre, who had seated herself at his 
right hand, in the place of high honor. Lady Selyse was on his left, flashing a smile as bright and brittle as 
her jewels. 
Too far, Cressen thought dully, looking at where Ser Davos was seated. Half of the lords bannermen 
were between the smuggler and the high table. I must be closer to her if I am to get the strangler into her 
cup, yet how? 
Patchface was capering about as the maester made his slow way around the table to Davos Seaworth. 
"Here we eat fish," the fool declared happily, waving a cod about like a scepter. "Under the sea, the fish 
eat us. I know, I know, oh, oh, oh." 
Ser Davos moved aside to make room on the bench. "We all should be in motley tonight," he said 
gloomily as Cressen seated himself, "for this is fool's business we're about. The red woman has seen 
victory in her flames, so Stannis means to press his claim, no matter what the numbers. Before she's done 
we're all like to see what Patchface saw, I fearthe bottom of the sea." 
Cressen slid his hands up into his sleeves as if for warmth. His fingers found the hard lumps the crystals 
made in the wool. "Lord Stannis." 
Page 15

Stannis turned from the red woman, but it was Lady Selyse who replied. "King Stannis. You forget 
yourself, Maester." 
"He is old, his mind wanders," the king told her gruffly. "What is it, Cressen? Speak your mind." 
"As you intend to sail, it is vital that you make common cause with Lord Stark and Lady Arryn . . . 
"I make common cause with no one," Stannis Baratheon said. 
"No more than light makes common cause with darkness." Lady Selyse took his hand. 
Stannis nodded. "The Starks seek to steal half my kingdom, even as the Lannisters have stolen my 
throne and my own sweet brother the swords and service and strongholds that are mine by rights. They 
are all usurpers, and they are all my enemies." 
I have lost him, Cressen thought, despairing. If only he could somehow approach Melisandre unseen . . . 
he needed but an instant's access to her cup. "You are the rightful heir to your brother Robert, the true 
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men," he said 
desperately, "but even so, you cannot hope to triumph without allies." 
"He has an ally," Lady Selyse said. "WhIlor, the Lord of Light, the Heart of Fire, the God of Flame and 
Shadow." 
"Gods make uncertain allies at best," the old man insisted, "and that one has no power here." 
"You think not?" The ruby at Melisandre's throat caught the light as she turned her head, and for an 
instant it seemed to glow bright as the comet. "If you will speak such folly, Maester, you ought to wear 
your crown again." 
"Yes," Lady Selyse agreed. "Patches's helm. It suits you well, old man. Put it on again, I command you." 
"Under the sea, no one wears hats," Patchface said. "I know, I know, oh, oh, oh." 
Lord Stannis's eyes were shadowed beneath his heavy brow, his mouth tight as his jaw worked silently. 
He always ground his teeth when he was angry. "Fool," he growled at last, "my lady wife commands. 
Give Cressen your helm." 
No, the old maester thought, this is not you, not your way, you were always just, always hard yet never 
cruel, never, you did not understand mockery, no more than you understood laughter. 
Patchface danced closer, his cowbells ringing, clang-a-lang, ding-ding, clink-clank-clink-clank. The 
maester sat silent while the fool set the antlered bucket on his brow. Cressen bowed his head beneath the 
weight. His bells clanged. "Perhaps he ought sing his counsel henceforth," Lady Selyse said. 
"You go too far, woman," Lord Stannis said. "He is an old man, and he's served me well." 
And I will serve you to the last, my sweet lord, my poor lonely son, Cressen thought, for suddenly he 
saw the way. Ser Davos's cup was before him, still half-full of sour red. He found a hard flake of crystal 
in his sleeve, held it tight between thumb and forefinger as he reached for the cup. Smooth motions, deft, 
I must not fumble now, he prayed, and 
Page 16

the gods were kind. In the blink of an eye, his fingers were empty. His hands had not been so steady for 
years, nor half so fluid. Davos saw, but no one else, he was certain. Cup in hand, he rose to his feet. 
"Mayhaps I have been a fool. Lady Melisandre, will you share a cup of wine with me? A cup in honor of 
your god, your Lord of Light? A cup to toast his power? " 
The red woman studied him. "If you wish." 
He could feel them all watching him. Davos clutched at him as he left the bench, catching his sleeve with 
the fingers that Lord Stannis had shortened. "What are you doing?" he whispered. 
"A thing that must be done," Maester Cressen answered, "for the sake of the realm, and the soul of my 
lord." He shook off Davos's hand, spilling a drop of wine on the rushes. 
She met him beneath the high table with every man's eyes upon them. But Cressen saw only her. Red 
silk, red eyes, the ruby red at her throat, red lips curled in a faint smile as she put her hand atop his own, 
around the cup. Her skin felt hot, feverish. "It is not too late to spill the wine, Maester." 
"No," he whispered hoarsely. "No." 
"As you will." Melisandre of Asshai took the cup from his hands and drank long and deep. There was 
only half a swallow of wine remaining when she offered it back to him. "And now you." 
His hands were shaking, but he made himself be strong. A maester of the Citadel must not be afraid. The 
wine was sour on his tongue. He let the empty cup drop from his fingers to shatter on the floor. "He does 
have power here, my lord," the woman said. "And fire cleanses." At her throat, the ruby shimmered 
redly. 
Cressen tried to reply, but his words caught in his throat. His cough became a terrible thin whistle as he 
strained to suck in air. Iron fingers tightened round his neck. As he sank to his knees, still he shook his 
head, denying her, denying her power, denying her magic, denying her god. And the cowbells peeled in 
his antlers, singing fool, fool, fool while the red woman looked down on him in pity, the candle flames 
dancing in her red red eyes. 
CHAPTER 1 
ARYA 
At Winterfell they had called her "Arya Horseface" and she'd thought nothing could be worse, but that 
was before the orphan boy Lommy Greenhands had named her "Lumpyhead." 
Her head felt lumpy when she touched it. When Yoren had dragged her into that alley she'd thought he 
meant to kill her, but the sour old man had only held her tight, sawing through her mats and tangles with 
his dagger. She remembered how the breeze sent the fistfuls of dirty brown hair skittering across the 
paving stones, toward the sept where her father had died. "I'm taking men and boys from the city," Yoren 
growled as the sharp steel scraped at her head. "Now you hold still, boy." By the time he had finished, 
her scalp was nothing but tufts and stubble. 
Page 17

Afterward he told her that from there to Winterfell she'd be Arry the orphan boy. "Gate shouldn't be 
hard, but the road's another matter. You got a long way to go in bad company. I got thirty this time, men 
and boys all bound for the Wall, and don't be thinking they're like that bastard brother o' yours." He 
shook her. "Lord Eddard gave me pick o' the dungeons, and I didn't find no little lordlings down there. 
This lot, half o' them would turn you over to the queen quick as spit for a pardon and maybe a few 
silvers. The other half'd do the same, only they'd rape you first. So you keep to yourself and make your 
water in the woods, alone. That'll be the hardest part, the pissing, so don't drink no more'n you need." 
Leaving King's Landing was easy, just like he'd said. The Lannister 
guardsmen on the gate were stopping everyone, but Yoren called one by name and their wagons were 
waved through. No one spared Arya a glance. They were looking for a highborn girl, daughter of the 
King's Hand, not for a skinny boy with his hair chopped off. Arya never looked back. She wished the 
Rush would rise and wash the whole city away, Flea Bottom and the Red Keep and the Great Sept and 
everything, and everyone too, especially Prince Joffrey and his mother. But she knew it wouldn't, and 
anyhow Sansa was still in the city and would wash away too. When she remembered that, Arya decided 
to wish for Winterfell instead. 
Yoren was wrong about the pissing, though. That wasn't the hardest part at all; Lommy Greenhands and 
Hot Pie were the hardest part. Orphan boys. Yoren had plucked some from the streets with promises of 
food for their bellies and shoes for their feet. The rest he'd found in chains. "The Watch needs good 
men," he told them as they set out, "but you lot will have to do." 
Yoren had taken grown men from the dungeons as well, thieves and poachers and rapers and the like. 
The worst were the three he'd found in the black cells who must have scared even him, because he kept 
them fettered hand and foot in the back of a wagon, and vowed they'd stay in irons all the way to the 
Wall. One had no nose, only the hole in his face where it had been cut off, and the gross fat bald one with 
the pointed teeth and the weeping sores on his cheeks had eyes like nothing human. 
They took five wagons out of King's Landing, laden with supplies for the Wall: hides and bolts of cloth, 
bars of pig iron, a cage of ravens, books and paper and ink, a bale of sourleaf, jars of oil, and chests of 
medicine and spices. Teams of plow horses pulled the wagons, and Yoren had bought two coursers and 
a half-dozen donkeys for the boys. Arya would have preferred a real horse, but the donkey was better 
than riding on a wagon. 
The men paid her no mind, but she was not so lucky with the boys. She was two years younger than the 
youngest orphan, not to mention smaller and skinnier, and Lommy and Hot Pie took her silence to mean 
she was scared, or stupid, or deaf. "Look at that sword Lumpyhead's got there," Lommy said one 
morning as they made their plodding way past orchards and wheat fields. He'd been a dyer's apprentice 
before he was caught stealing, and his arms were mottled green to the elbow. When he laughed he 
brayed like the donkeys they were riding. "Where's a gutter rat like Lumpyhead get him a sword?" 
Arya chewed her lip sullenly. She could see the back of Yoren's faded black cloak up ahead of the 
wagons, but she was determined not to go crying to him for help. 
"Maybe he's a little squire," Hot Pie put in. His mother had been a 
baker before she died, and he'd pushed her cart through the streets all day, shouting "Hot pies! Hot 
pies!" "Some lordy lord's little squire boy, that's it." 
Page 18

"He ain't no squire, look at him. I bet that's not even a real sword. I bet it's just some play sword made 
of tin." 
Arya hated them making fun of Needle. "It's castle-forged steel, you stupid," she snapped, turning in the 
saddle to glare at them, "and you better shut your mouth." 
The orphan boys hooted. "Where'd you get a blade like that, Lumpyface?" Hot Pie wanted to know. 
"Lumpyhead," corrected Lommy. "He prob'ly stole it." 
"I did not!" she shouted. Jon Snow had given her Needle. Maybe she had to let them call her 
Lumpyhead, but she wasn't going to let them call Jon a thief. 
"If he stole it, we could take it off him," said Hot Pie. "It's not his anyhow. I could use me a sword like 
that." 
Lommy egged him on. "Go on, take it off him, I dare you." 
Hot Pie kicked his donkey, riding closer. "Hey, Lumpyface, you gimme that sword." His hair was the 
color of straw, his fat face all sunburnt and peeling. "You don't know how to use it." 
Yes I do, Arya could have said. I killed a boy, a fat boy like you, I stabbed him in the belly and he died, 
and I'll kill you too if you don't let me alone. Only she did not dare. Yoren didn't know about the 
stableboy, but she was afraid of what he might do if he found out. Arya was pretty sure that some of the 
other men were killers too, the three in the manacles for sure, but the queen wasn't looking for them, so it 
wasn't the same. 
"Look at him," brayed Lommy Greenhands. "I bet he's going to cry now. You want to cry, 
Lumpyhead?" 
She had cried in her sleep the night before, dreaming of her father. Come morning, she'd woken 
red-eyed and dry, and could not have shed another tear if her life had hung on it. 
"He's going to wet his pants," Hot Pie suggested. 
"Leave him be," said the boy with the shaggy black hair who rode behind them. Lommy had named him 
the Bull, on account of this horned helm he had that he polished all the time but never wore. Lommy 
didn't dare mock the Bull. He was older, and big for his age, with a broad chest and strong-looking arms. 
"You better give Hot Pie the sword, Arry," Lommy said. "Hot Pie wants it bad. He kicked a boy to 
death. He'll do the same to you, I bet." 
"I knocked him down and I kicked him in the balls, and I kept kicking him there until he was dead," Hot 
Pie boasted. "I kicked him all to 
pieces. His balls were broke open and bloody and his cock turned black. You better gimme the sword." 
Arya slid her practice sword from her belt. "You can have this one," she told Hot Pie, not wanting to 
fight. 
"That's just some stick." He rode nearer and tried to reach over for Needle's hilt. 
Page 19

Arya made the stick whistle as she laid the wood across his donkey's hindquarters. The animal hawed 
and bucked, dumping Hot Pie on the ground. She vaulted off her own donkey and poked him in the gut 
as he tried to get up and he sat back down with a grunt. Then she whacked him across the face and his 
nose made a crack like a branch breaking. Blood dribbled from his nostrils. When Hot Pie began to wail, 
Arya whirled toward Lommy Greenhands, who was sitting on his donkey openmouthed. "You want 
some sword too?" she yelled, but he didn't. He raised dyed green hands in front of his face and squealed 
at her to get away. 
The Bull shouted, "Behind you," and Arya spun. Hot Pie was on his knees, his fist closing around a big 
jagged rock. She let him throw it, ducking her head as it sailed past. Then she flew at him. He raised a 
hand and she hit it, and then his cheek, and then his knee. He grabbed for her, and she danced aside and 
bounced the wood off the back of his head. He fell down and got up and stumbled after her, his red face 
all smeared with dirt and blood. Arya slid into a water dancer's stance and waited. When he came close 
enough, she lunged, right between his legs, so hard that if her wooden sword had had a point it would 
have come out between his butt cheeks. 
By the time Yoren pulled her off him, Hot Pie was sprawled out on the ground with his breeches brown 
and smelly, crying as Arya whapped him over and over and over. "Enough," the black brother roared, 
prying the stick sword from her fingers, "you want to kill the fool?" When Lommy and some others 
started to squeal, the old man turned on them too. "Shut your mouths, or I'll be shutting them for you. 
Any more o' this, I'll tie you lot behind the wagons and drag you to the Wall." He spat. "And that goes 
twice for you, Arry. You come with me, boy. Now" 
They were all looking at her, even the three chained and manacled in the back of the wagon. The fat one 
snapped his pointy teeth together and hissed, but Arya ignored him. 
The old man dragged her well off the road into a tangle of trees, cursing and muttering all the while. "If I 
had a thimble o' sense, I would've left you in King's Landing. You hear me, boy?" He always snarled that 
word, putting a bite in it so she would be certain to hear. "Unlace your breeches and pull 'em down. Go 
on, there's no one here to see. Do it." 
Sullenly, Arya did as he said. "Over there, against the oak. Yes, like that." She wrapped her arms 
around the trunk and pressed her face to the rough wood. "You scream now. You scream loud." 
I won't, Arya thought stubbornly, but when Yoren laid the wood against the back of her bare thighs, the 
shriek burst out of her anyway. "Think that hurt?" he said. "Try this one." The stick came whistling. Arya 
shrieked again, clutching the tree to keep from falling. "One more." She held on tight, chewing her lip, 
flinching when she heard it coming. The stroke made her jump and howl. I won't cry, she thought, I won't 
do that. I'm a Stark of Winterfell, our sigil is the direwolf, direwolves don't cry. She could feel a thin 
trickle of blood running down her left leg. Her thighs and cheeks were ablaze with pain. "Might be I got 
your attention now," Yoren said. "Next time you take that stick to one of your brothers, you'll get twice 
what you give, you hear me? Now cover yourself." 
They're not my brothers, Arya thought as she bent to yank up her breeches, but she knew better than to 
say so. Her hands fumbled with her belt and laces. 
Yoren was looking at her. "You hurt?" 
Calm as still water, she told herself, the way Syrio Forel had taught her. "Some." 
Page 20

He spat. "That pie boy's hurting worse. It wasn't him as killed your father, girl, nor that thieving Lommy 
neither. Hitting them won't bring him back." 
"I know," Arya muttered sullenly. 
"Here's something you don't know. It wasn't supposed to happen like it did. I was set to leave, wagons 
bought and loaded, and a man comes with a boy for me, and a purse of coin, and a message, never mind 
who it's from. Lord Eddard's to take the black, he says to me, wait, he'll be going with you. Why d'you 
think I was there? Only something went queer." 
"loffrey," Arya breathed. "Someone should kill him!" 
"Someone will, but it won't be me, nor you neither." Yoren tossed back her stick sword. "Got sourleaf 
back at the wagons," he said as they made their way back to the road. "You'll chew some, it'll help with 
the sting." 
It did help, some, though the taste of it was foul and it made her spit look like blood. Even so, she 
walked for the rest of that day, and the day after, and the day after that, too raw to sit a donkey. Hot Pie 
was worse off; Yoren had to shift some barrels around so he could lie in the back of a wagon on some 
sacks of barley, and he whimpered every time the wheels hit a rock. Lommy Greenhands wasn't even 
hurt, yet he stayed as far away from Arya as he could get. "Every time you look at him, he 
twitches," the Bull told her as she walked beside his donkey. She did not answer. It seemed safer not to 
talk to anyone. 
That night she lay upon her thin blanket on the hard ground, staring up at the great red comet. The comet 
was splendid and scary all at once. "The Red Sword," the Bull named it; he claimed it looked like a 
sword, the blade still red-hot from the forge. When Arya squinted the right way she could see the sword 
too, only it wasn't a new sword, it was Ice, her father's greatsword, all ripply Valyrian steel, and the red 
was Lord Eddard's blood on the blade after Ser Ilyn the King's justice had cut off his head. Yoren had 
made her look away when it happened, yet it seemed to her that the comet looked like Ice must have, 
after. 
When at last she slept, she dreamed of home. The kingsroad wound its way past Winterfell on its way to 
the Wall, and Yoren had promised he'd leave her there with no one any wiser about who she'd been. She 
yearned to see her mother again, and Robb and Bran and Rickon . . . but it was Jon Snow she thought of 
most. She wished somehow they could come to the Wall before Winterfell, so Jon might muss up her hair 
and call her "little sister." She'd tell him, "I missed you," and he'd say it too at the very same moment, the 
way they always used to say things together. She would have liked that. She would have liked that better 
than anything. 
CHAPTER 2 
SANSA 
The morning of King Joffrey's name day dawned bright and windy, with the long tail of the great comet 
visible through the high scuttling clouds. Sansa was watching it from her tower window when Ser Arys 
Page 21

Oakheart arrived to escort her down to the tourney grounds. "What do you think it means?" she asked 
him. 
"Glory to your betrothed," Ser Arys answered at once. "See how it flames across the sky today on His 
Grace's name day, as if the gods themselves had raised a banner in his honor. The smallfolk have named 
it King Joffrey's Comet." 
Doubtless that was what they told Joffrey; Sansa was not so sure. "I've heard servants calling it the 
Dragon's Tail." 
"King Joffrey sits where Aegon the Dragon once sat, in the castle built by his son," Ser Arys said. "He is 
the dragon's heir-and crimson is the color of House Lannister, another sign. This comet is sent to herald 
Joffrey's ascent to the throne, I have no doubt. It means that he will triumph over his enemies." 
Is it true? she wondered. Would the gods be so cruel? Her mother was one of Joffrey's enemies now, 
her brother Robb another. Her father had died by the king's command. Must Robb and her lady mother 
die next? The comet was red, but Joffrey was Baratheon as much as Lannister, and their sigil was a black 
stag on a golden field. Shouldn't the gods have sent Joff a golden comet? 
Sansa closed the shutters and turned sharply away from the window. "You look very lovely today, my 
lady," Ser Arys said. 
"Thank you, ser." Knowing that Joffrey would require her to attend the tourney in his honor, Sansa had 
taken special care with her face and clothes. She wore a gown of pale purple silk and a moonstone hair 
net that had been a gift from Joffrey. The gown had long sleeves to hide the bruises on her arms. Those 
were Joffrey's gifts as well. When they told him that Robb had been proclaimed King in the North, his 
rage had been a fearsome thing, and he had sent Ser Boros to beat her. 
"Shall we go?" Ser Arys offered his arm and she let him lead her from her chamber. If she must have one 
of the Kingsguard dogging her steps, Sansa preferred that it be him. Ser Boros was short-tempered, Ser 
Meryn cold, and Ser Mandon's strange dead eyes made her uneasy, while Ser Preston treated her like a 
lackwit child. Arys Oakheart was courteous, and would talk to her cordially. Once he even objected 
when Joffrey commanded him to hit her. He did hit her in the end, but not hard as Ser Meryn or Ser 
Boros might have, and at least he had argued. The others obeyed without question . . . except for the 
Hound, but Joff never asked the Hound to punish her. He used the other five for that. 
Ser Arys had light brown hair and a face that was not unpleasant to look upon. Today he made quite the 
dashing figure, with his white silk cloak fastened at the shoulder by a golden leaf, and a spreading oak 
tree worked upon the breast of his tunic in shining gold thread. "Who do you think will win the day's 
honors?" Sansa asked as they descended the steps arm in arm. 
"I will," Ser Arys answered, smiling. "Yet I fear the triumph will have no savor. This will be a small field, 
and poor. No more than two score will enter the lists, including squires and freeriders. There is small 
honor in unhorsing green boys." 
The last tourney had been different, Sansa reflected. King Robert had staged it in her father's honor. 
High lords and fabled champions had come from all over the realm to compete, and the whole city had 
turned out to watch. She remembered the splendor of it: the field of pavilions along the river with a 
knight's shield hung before each door, the long rows of silken pennants waving in the wind, the gleam of 
sunlight on bright steel and gilded spurs. The days had rung to the sounds of trumpets and pounding 
hooves, and the nights had been full of feasts and song. Those had been the most magical days of her life, 
Page 22

but they seemed a memory from another age now. Robert Baratheon was dead, and her father as well, 
beheaded for a traitor on the steps of the Great Sept of Baelor. Now there were three kings in the land, 
and war raged beyond the Trident while the city filled with desperate men. Small wonder that they 
had to hold Joff's tournament behind the thick stone walls of the Red Keep. 
"Will the queen attend, do you think?" Sansa always felt safer when Cersei was there to restrain her son. 
"I fear not, my lady. The council is meeting, some urgent business." Ser Arys dropped his voice. "Lord 
Tywin has gone to ground at Harrenhal instead of bringing his army to the city as the queen commanded. 
Her Grace is furious." He fell silent as a column of Lannister guardsmen marched past, in crimson cloaks 
and lion-crested helms. Ser Arys was fond of gossip, but only when he was certain that no one was 
listening. 
The carpenters had erected a gallery and lists in the outer bailey. It was a poor thing indeed, and the 
meager throng that had gathered to watch filled but half the seats. Most of the spectators were 
guardsmen in the gold cloaks of the City Watch or the crimson of House Lannister; of lords and ladies 
there were but a paltry few, the handful that remained at court. Grey-faced Lord Gyles Rosby was 
coughing into a square of pink silk. Lady Tanda. was bracketed by her daughters, placid dull Lollys and 
acid-tongued Falyse. Ebon-skinned Jalabhar Xho was an exile who had no other refuge, Lady 
Ermesande a babe seated on her wet nurse's lap. The talk was she would soon be wed to one of the 
queen's cousins, so the Lannisters might claim her lands. 
The king was shaded beneath a crimson canopy, one leg thrown negligently over the carved wooden 
arm of his chair. Princess Myrcella and Prince Tornmen sat behind him. In the back of the royal box, 
Sandor Clegane stood at guard, his hands resting on his swordbelt. The white cloak of the Kingsguard 
was draped over his broad shoulders and fastened with a jeweled brooch, the snowy cloth looking 
somehow unnatural against his brown roughspun tunic and studded leather jerkin. "Lady Sansa," the 
Hound announced curtly when he saw her. His voice was as rough as the sound of a saw on wood. The 
burn scars on his face and throat made one side of his mouth twitch when he spoke. 
Princess Myrcella nodded a shy greeting at the sound of Sansa's name, but plump little Prince Tommen 
jumped up eagerly. "Sansa, did you hear? I'm to ride in the tourney today. Mother said I could." 
Tornmen was all of eight. He reminded her of her own little brother, Bran. They were of an age. Bran 
was back at Winterfell, a cripple, yet safe. 
Sansa would have given anything to be with him. "I fear for the life of your foeman," she told Tornmen 
solemnly. 
"His foeman will be stuffed with straw," Joff said as he rose. The king was clad in a gilded breastplate 
with a roaring lion engraved upon its chest, as if he expected the war to engulf them at any moment. He 
was thirteen today, and tall for his age, with the green eyes and golden hair of the Lannisters. 
"Your Grace," she said, dipping in a curtsy. 
Ser Arys bowed. "Pray pardon me, Your Grace. I must equip myself for the lists." 
Joffrey waved a curt dismissal while he studied Sansa from head to heels. "I'm pleased you wore my 
stones." 
So the king had decided to play the gallant today. Sansa was relieved. "I thank you for them . . . and for 
Page 23

your tender words. I pray you a lucky name day, Your Grace." 
"Sit," Joff commanded, gesturing her to the empty seat beside his own. "Have you heard? The Beggar 
King is dead." 
"Who?" For a moment Sansa was afraid he meant Robb. 
"Viserys. The last son of Mad King Aerys. He's been going about the Free Cities since before I was 
born, calling himself a king. Well, Mother says the Dothraki finally crowned him. With molten gold." He 
laughed. "That's funny, don't you think? The dragon was their sigil. It's almost as good as if some wolf 
killed your traitor brother. Maybe I'll feed him to wolves after I've caught him. Did I tell you, I intend to 
challenge him to single combat?" 
"I should like to see that, Your Grace." More than you know Sansa kept her tone cool and polite, yet 
even so Joffrey's eyes narrowed as he tried to decide whether she was mocking him. "Will you enter the 
lists today?" she asked quickly. 
The king frowned. "My lady mother said it was not fitting, since the tourney is in my honor. Otherwise I 
would have been champion. Isn't that so, dog?" 
The Hound's mouth twitched. "Against this lot? Why not?" 
He had been the champion in her father's tourney, Sansa remembered. "Will you joust today, my lord?" 
she asked him. 
Clegane's voice was thick with contempt. "Wouldn't be worth the bother of arming myself. This is a 
tournament of gnats." 
The king laughed. "My dog has a fierce bark. Perhaps I should command him to fight the day's 
champion. To the death." Joffrey was fond of making men fight to the death. 
"You'd be one knight the poorer." The Hound had never taken a knight's vows. His brother was a 
knight, and he hated his brother. 
A blare of trumpets sounded. The king settled back in his seat and took Sansa's hand. Once that would 
have set her heart to pounding, but that was before he had answered her plea for mercy by presenting 
her with her father's head. His touch filled her with revulsion now, but she knew better than to show it. 
She made herself sit very still. 
"Ser Meryn Trant of the Kingsguard, " a herald called. 
Ser Meryn entered from the west side of the yard, clad in gleaming white plate chased with gold and 
mounted on a milk-white charger with 
a flowing grey mane. His cloak streamed behind him like a field of snow. He carried a twelve-foot lance. 
"Ser Hobber of House Redwyne, of the Arbor," the herald sang. Ser Hobber trotted in from the east, 
riding a black stallion caparisoned in burgundy and blue. His lance was striped in the same colors, and his 
shield bore the grape cluster sigil of his House. The Redwyne twins were the queen's unwilling guests, 
even as Sansa was. She wondered whose notion it had been for them to ride in Joffrey's tourney. Not 
their own, she thought. 
Page 24

At a signal from the master of revels, the combatants couched their lances and put their spurs to their 
mounts. There were shouts from the watching guardsmen and the lords and ladies in the gallery. The 
knights came together in the center of the yard with a great shock of wood and steel. The white lance and 
the striped one exploded in splinters within a second of each other. Hobber Redwyne reeled at the 
impact, yet somehow managed to keep his seat. Wheeling their horses about at the far end of the lists, 
the knights tossed down their broken lances and accepted replacements from the squires. Ser Horas 
Redwyne, Ser Hobber's twin, shouted encouragement to his brother. 
But on their second pass Ser Meryn swung the point of his lance to strike Ser Hobber in the chest, 
driving him from the saddle to crash resoundingly to the earth. Ser Horas cursed and ran out to help his 
battered brother from the field. 
"Poorly ridden," declared King Joffrey. 
"Ser Balon Swann, of Stonehelm in the Red Watch," came the herald's cry. Wide white wings 
ornamented Ser Balon's greathelm, and black and white swans fought on his shield. "Morros of House 
Slynt, heir to Lord Janos of Harrenhal." 
"Look at that upiumped oaf," Joff hooted, loud enough for half the yard to hear. Morros, a mere squire 
and a new-made squire at that, was having difficulty managing lance and shield. The lance was a knight's 
weapon, Sansa knew, the Slynts lowborn. Lord Janos had been no more than commander of the City 
Watch before Joffrey had raised him to Han renhal and the council. 
I hope he falls and shames himself, she thought bitterly. I hope Ser Balon kills him. When Joffrey 
proclaimed her father's death, it had been Janos Slynt who seized Lord Eddard's severed head by the 
hair and raised it on high for king and crowd to behold, while Sansa wept and screamed. 
Morros wore a checkered black-and-gold cloak over black armor inlaid with golden scrollwork. On his 
shield was the bloody spear his father had chosen as the sigil of their new-made house. But he did not 
seem to know what to do with the shield as he urged his horse forward, and Ser 
Balon's point struck the blazon square. Morros dropped his lance, fought for balance, and lost. One foot 
caught in a stirrup as he fell, and the runaway charger dragged the youth to the end of the lists, head 
bouncing against the ground. Joff hooted derision. Sansa was appalled, wondering if the gods had heard 
her vengeful prayer. But when they disentangled Morros Slynt from his horse, they found him bloodied 
but alive. "Tommen, we picked the wrong foe for you," the king told his brother. "The straw knight jousts 
better than that one." 
Next came Ser Horas Redwyne's turn. He fared better than his twin, vanquishing an elderly knight 
whose mount was bedecked with silver griffins against a striped blue-and-white field. Splendid as he 
looked, the old man made a poor contest of it. Joffrey curled his lip. "This is a feeble show." 
"I warned you," said the Hound. "Gnats." 
The king was growing bored. it made Sansa anxious. She lowered her eyes and resolved to keep quiet, 
no matter what. When Joffrey Baratheon's mood darkened, any chance word might set off one of his 
rages. 
"Lothor Brune, freerider in the service of Lord Baelish, " cried the herald. "Ser Dontos the Red, of 
House Hollard. " 
Page 25

The freerider, a small man in dented plate without device, duly appeared at the west end of the yard, but 
of his opponent there was no sign. Finally a chestnut stallion trotted into view in a swirl of crimson and 
scarlet silks, but Ser Dontos was not on it. The knight appeared a moment later, cursing and staggering, 
clad in breastplate and plumed helm and nothing else. His legs were pale and skinny, and his manhood 
flopped about obscenely as he chased after his horse. The watchers roared and shouted insults. Catching 
his horse by the bridle, Ser Dontos tried to mount, but the animal would not stand still and the knight was 
so drunk that his bare foot kept missing the stirrup. 
By then the crowd was howling with laughter . . . all but the king. Joffrey had a look in his eyes that 
Sansa remembered well, the same look he'd had at the Great Sept of Baelor the day he pronounced 
death on Lord Eddard Stark. Finally Ser Dontos the Red gave it up for a bad job, sat down in the dirt, 
and removed his plumed helm. "I lose," he shouted. "Fetch me some wine." 
The king stood. "A cask from the cellars! I'll see him drowned in it." 
Sansa heard herself gasp. "No, you can't." 
Joffrey turned his head. "What did you say?" 
Sansa could not believe she had spoken. Was she mad? To tell him no in front of half the court? She 
hadn't meant to say anything, only . . . Ser Dontos was drunk and silly and useless, but he meant no 
harm. 
"Did you say I can't? Did you?" 
"Please," Sansa said, "I only meant . . . it would be ill luck, Your Grace . . . to, to kill a man on your 
name day." 
"You're lying," Joffrey said. "I ought to drown you with him, if you care for him so much." 
"I don't care for him, Your Grace." The words tumbled out desperately. "Drown him or have his head 
off, only . . . kill him on the morrow, if you like, but please . . . not today, not on your name day. I 
couldn't bear for you to have ill luck . . . terrible luck, even for kings, the singers all say so . . . 
Joffrey scowled. He knew she was lying, she could see it. He would make her bleed for this. 
"The girl speaks truly," the Hound rasped. "What a man sows on his name day, he reaps throughout the 
year." His voice was flat, as if he did not care a whit whether the king believed him or no. Could it be 
true? Sansa had not known. It was just something she'd said, desperate to avoid punishment. 
Unhappy, Joffrey shifted in his seat and flicked his fingers at Ser Dontos. "Take him away. I'll have him 
killed on the morrow, the fool." 
"He is," Sansa said. "A fool. You're so clever, to see it. He's better fitted to be a fool than a knight, isn't 
he? You ought to dress him in motley and make him clown for you. He doesn't deserve the mercy of a 
quick death." 
The king studied her a moment. "Perhaps you're not so stupid as Mother says." He raised his voice. "Did 
you hear my lady, Dontos? From this day on, you're my new fool. You can sleep with Moon Boy and 
dress in motley." 
Page 26

Ser Dontos, sobered by his near brush with death, crawled to his knees. "Thank you, Your Grace. And 
you, my lady. Thank you." 
As a brace of Lannister guardsmen led him off, the master of revels approached the box. "Your Grace," 
he said, "shall I summon a new challenger for Brune, or proceed with the next tilt?" 
"Neither. These are gnats, not knights. I'd have them all put to death, only it's my name day. The tourney 
is done. Get them all out of my sight." 
The master of revels bowed, but Prince Tommen was not so obedient. "I'm supposed to ride against the 
straw man." 
"Not today." 
"But I want to ride!" 
"I don't care what you want." 
"Mother said I could ride." 
"She said," Princess Myrcella agreed. 
"Mother said," mocked the king. "Don't be childish." 
"We're children," Myrcella declared haughtily. "We're supposed to be childish." 
The Hound laughed. "She has you there." 
Joffrey was beaten. "Very well. Even my brother couldn't tilt any worse than these others. Master, bring 
out the quintain, Tommen wants to be a gnat." 
Tornmen gave a shout of joy and ran off to be readied, his chubby little legs pumping hard. "Luck," 
Sansa called to him. 
They set up the quintain at the far end of the lists while the prince's pony was being saddled. Tommen's 
opponent was a child-sized leather warrior stuffed with straw and mounted on a pivot, with a shield in 
one hand and a padded mace in the other. Someone had fastened a pair of antlers to the knight's head. 
Joffrey's father King Robert had worn antlers on his helm, Sansa remembered . . . but so did his uncle 
Lord Renly, Robert's brother, who had turned traitor and crowned himself king. 
A pair of squires buckled the prince into his ornate silver-and-crimson armor. A tall plume of red 
feathers sprouted from the crest of his helm, and the lion of Lannister and crowned stag of Baratheon 
frolicked together on his shield. The squires helped him mount, and Ser Aron Santagar, the Red Keep's 
master-at-arms, stepped forward and handed Tornmen a blunted silver longsword with a leaf-shaped 
blade, crafted to fit an eight-year-old hand. 
Tornmen raised the blade high. "Casterly Rock!" he shouted in a high boyish voice as he put his heels 
into his pony and started across the hard-packed dirt at the quintain. Lady Tanda and Lord Gyles started 
a ragged cheer, and Sansa added her voice to theirs. The king brooded in silence. 
Page 27

Tornmen got his pony up to a brisk trot, waved his sword vigorously, and struck the knight's shield a 
solid blow as he went by. The quintain spun, the padded mace flying around to give the prince a mighty 
whack in the back of his head. Tommen spilled from the saddle, his new armor rattling like a bag of old 
pots as he hit the ground. His sword went flying, his pony cantered away across the bailey, and a great 
gale of derision went up. King Joffrey laughed longest and loudest of all. 
"Oh," Princess Myrcella cried. She scrambled out of the box and ran to her little brother. 
Sansa found herself possessed of a queer giddy courage. "You should go with her," she told the king. 
"Your brother might be hurt." 
Joffrey shrugged. "What if he is?" 
"You should help him up and tell him how well he rode." Sansa could not seem to stop herself. 
"He got knocked off his horse and fell in the dirt," the king pointed out. "That's not riding well." 
"Look," the Hound interrupted. "The boy has courage. He's going to try again." 
They were helping Prince Tornmen mount his pony. If only Tommen were the elder instead of foffrey, 
Sansa thought. I wouldn't mind marrying Tommen. 
The sounds from the gatehouse took them by surprise. Chains rattled as the portcullis was drawn 
upward, and the great gates opened to the creak of iron hinges. "Who told them to open the gate?" Joff 
demanded. With the troubles in the city, the gates of the Red Keep had been closed for days. 
A column of riders emerged from beneath the portcullis with a clink of steel and a clatter of hooves. 
Clegane stepped close to the king, one hand on the hilt of his longsword. The visitors were dinted and 
haggard and dusty, yet the standard they carried was the lion of Lannister, golden on its crimson field. A 
few wore the red cloaks and mail of Lannister men-at-arms, but more were freeriders and sellswords, 
armored in oddments and bristling with sharp steel . . . and there were others, monstrous savages out of 
one of Old Nan's tales, the scary ones Bran used to love. They were clad in shabby skins and boiled 
leather, with long hair and fierce beards. Some wore bloodstained bandages over their brows or 
wrapped around their hands, and others were missing eyes, ears, and fingers. 
In their midst, riding on a tall red horse in a strange high saddle that cradled him back and front, was the 
queen's dwarf brother Tyrion Lannister, the one they called the Imp. He had let his beard grow to cover 
his pushed-in face, until it was a bristly tangle of yellow and black hair, coarse as wire. Down his back 
flowed a shadowskin cloak, black fur striped with white. He held the reins in his left hand and carried his 
right arm in a white silk sling, but otherwise looked as grotesque as Sansa remembered from when he 
had visited Winterfell. With his bulging brow and mismatched eyes, he was still the ugliest man she had 
ever chanced to look upon. 
Yet Tornmen put his spurs into his pony and galloped headlong across the yard, shouting with glee. One 
of the savages, a huge shambling man so hairy that his face was all but lost beneath his whiskers, scooped 
the boy out of his saddle, armor and all, and deposited him on the ground beside his uncle. Tommen's 
breathless laughter echoed off the walls as Tyrion clapped him on the backplate, and Sansa was startled 
to see that the two were of a height. Myrcella came running after her brother, and the dwarf picked her 
up by the waist and spun her in a circle, squealing. 
When he lowered her back to the ground, the little man kissed her lightly on the brow and came 
Page 28

waddling across the yard toward Joffrey. 
Two of his men followed close behind him; a black-haired black-eyed sellsword who moved like a 
stalking cat, and a gaunt youth with an empty socket where one eye should have been. Tornmen and 
Myrcella trailed after them. 
The dwarf went to one knee before the king. "Your Grace." 
"You," Joffrey said. 
"Me," the Imp agreed, "although a more courteous greeting might be in order, for an uncle and an elder." 
"They said you were dead," the Hound said. 
The little man gave the big one a look. One of his eyes was green, one was black, and both were cool. 
"I was speaking to the king, not to his cur." 
"I'm glad you're not dead," said Princess Myrcella. 
"We share that view, sweet child." Tyrion turned to Sansa. "My lady, I am sorry for your losses. Truly, 
the gods are cruel." 
Sansa could not think of a word to say to him. How could he be sorry for her losses? Was he mocking 
her? It wasn't the gods who'd been cruel, it was Joffrey. 
"I am sorry for your loss as well, Joffrey," the dwarf said. 
"What loss?" 
"Your royal father? A large fierce man with a black beard; you'll recall him if you try. He was king 
before you." 
"Oh, him. Yes, it was very sad, a boar killed him." 
"Is that what 'they' say, Your Grace?" 
Joffrey frowned. Sansa felt that she ought to say something. What was it that Septa Mordane used to tell 
her? A lady's armor is courtesy, that was it. She donned her armor and said, "I'm sorry my lady mother 
took you captive, my lord." 
"A great many people are sorry for that," Tyrion replied, "and before I am done, some may be a deal 
sorrier . . . yet I thank you for the sentiment. Joffrey, where might I find your mother?" 
"She's with my council," the king answered. "Your brother Jaime keeps losing battles." He gave Sansa 
an angry look, as if it were her fault. "He's been taken by the Starks and we've lost Riverrun and now her 
stupid brother is calling himself a king." 
The dwarf smiled crookedly. "All sorts of people are calling themselves kings these days." 
Joff did not know what to make of that, though he looked suspicious and out of sorts. "Yes. Well. I am 
pleased you're not dead, Uncle. Did you bring me a gift for my name day?" 
Page 29

"I did. My wits." 
"I'd sooner have Robb Stark's head," Joff said with a sly glance at Sansa. "Tommen, Myrcella, come." 
Sandor Clegane lingered behind a moment. "I'd guard that tongue of yours, little man," he warned, 
before he strode off after his liege. 
Sansa was left with the dwarf and his monsters. She tried to think of what else she might say. "You hurt 
your arm," she managed at last. 
"One of your northmen hit me with a morningstar during the battle on the Green Fork. I escaped him by 
falling off my horse." His grin turned into something softer as he studied her face. "Is it grief for your lord 
father that makes you so sad?" 
"My father was a traitor," Sansa said at once. "And my brother and lady mother are traitors as well." 
That reflex she had learned quickly. "I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey." 
"No doubt. As loyal as a deer surrounded by wolves." 
"Lions," she whispered, without thinking. She glanced about nervously, but there was no one close 
enough to hear. 
Lannister reached out and took her hand, and gave it a squeeze. "I am only a little lion, child, and I vow, 
I shall not savage you." Bowing, he said "But now you must excuse me. I have urgent business with 
queen and council." 
Sansa watched him walk off, his body swaying heavily from side to side with every step, like something 
from a grotesquerie. He speaks more gently than foffrey, she thought, but the queen spoke to me gently 
too. He's still a Lannister, her brother and foff's uncle, and no friend. Once she had loved Prince Joffrey 
with all her heart, and admired and trusted his mother, the queen. They had repaid that love and trust with 
her father's head. Sansa would never make that mistake again. 
CHAPTER 3 
TYRION 
In the chilly white raiment of the Kingsguard, Ser Mandon Moore looked like a corpse in a shroud. "Her 
Grace left orders, the council in session is not to be disturbed." 
"I would be only a small disturbance, ser." Tyrion slid the parchment from his sleeve. "I bear a letter from 
my father, Lord Tywin Lannister, the Hand of the King. There is his seal." 
"Her Grace does not wish to be disturbed," Ser Mandon repeated slowly, as if Tyrion were a dullard 
who had not heard him the first time. 
Jaime had once told him that Moore was the most dangerous of the Kingsguard-excepting himself, 
Page 30

always-because his face gave no hint as what he might do next. Tyrion would have welcomed a hint. 
Bronn and Timett could likely kill the knight if it came to swords, but it would scarcely bode well if he 
began by slaying one of Joffrey's protectors. Yet if he let the man turn him away, where was his 
authority? He made himself smile. "Ser Mandon, you have not met my companions. This is Timett son of 
Timett, a red hand of the Burned Men. And this is Bronn. Perchance you recall Ser Vardis Egen, who 
was captain of Lord Arryn's household guard?" 
"I know the man." Ser Mandon's eyes were pale grey, oddly flat and lifeless. 
"Knew," Bronn corrected with a thin smile. 
Ser Mandon did not deign to show that he had heard that. 
"Be that as it may," Tyrion said lightly, "I truly must see my sister 
and present my letter, ser. If you would be so kind as to open the door for us?" 
The white knight did not respond. Tyrion was almost at the point of trying to force his way past when 
Ser Mandon abruptly stood aside. "You may enter. They may not." 
A small victory, he thought, but sweet. He had passed his first test. Tyrion Lannister shouldered through 
the door, feeling almost tall. Five members of the king's small council broke off their discussion suddenly. 
"You," his sister Cersei said in a tone that was equal parts disbelief and distaste. 
"I can see where Joffrey learned his courtesies." Tyrion paused to admire the pair of Valyrian sphinxes 
that guarded the door, affecting an air of casual confidence. Cersei could smell weakness the way a dog 
smells f ear. 
"What are you doing here?" His sister's lovely green eyes studied him without the least hint of affection. 
"Delivering a letter from our lord father." He sauntered to the table and placed the tightly rolled 
parchment between them. 
The eunuch Varys took the letter and turned it in his delicate powdered hands. "How kind of Lord 
Tywin. And his scaling wax is such a lovely shade of gold." Varys gave the seal a close inspection. "It 
gives every appearance of being genuine." 
"Of course it's genuine." Cersei snatched it out of his hands. She broke the wax and unrolled the 
parchment. 
Tyrion watched her read. His sister had taken the king's seat for herself-he gathered Joffrey did not often 
trouble to attend council meetings, no more than Robert had-so Tyrion climbed up into the Hand's chair. 
it seemed only appropriate. 
"This is absurd," the queen said at last. "My lord father has sent my brother to sit in his place in this 
council. He bids us accept Tyrion as the Hand of the King, until such time as he himself can join us." 
Grand Maester Pycelle stroked his flowing white beard and nodded ponderously. "It would seem that a 
welcome is in order." 
"Indeed." jowly, balding Janos Slynt looked rather like a frog, a smug frog who had gotten rather above 
Page 31

himself. "We have sore need of you, my lord. Rebellion everywhere, this grim omen in the sky, rioting in 
the city streets . . ." 
"And whose fault is that, Lord Janos?" Cersei lashed out. "Your gold cloaks are charged with keeping 
order. As to you, Tyrion, you could better serve us on the field of battle." 
He laughed. "No, I'm done with fields of battle, thank you. I sit a chair better than a horse, and I'd 
sooner hold a wine goblet than a battle-axe. All that about the thunder of the drums, sunlight flashing on 
armor, 
magnificent destriers snorting and prancing? Well, the drums gave me headaches, the sunlight flashing on 
my armor cooked me up like a harvest day goose, and those magnificent destriers shit everywhere. Not 
that I am complaining. Compared to the hospitality I enjoyed in the Vale of Arryn, drums, horseshit, and 
fly bites are my favorite things." 
Littlefinger laughed. "Well said, Lannister. A man after my own heart. " 
Tyrion smiled at him, remembering a certain dagger with a dragonbone hilt and a Valyrian steel blade. 
We must have a talk about that, and soon. He wondered if Lord Petyr would find that subject amusing as 
well. "Please," he told them, "do let me be of service, in whatever small way I can." 
Cersei read the letter again. "How many men have you brought with you? " 
"A few hundred. My own men, chiefly. Father was loath to part with any of his. He is fighting a war, 
after all." 
"What use will your few hundred men be if Renly marches on the city, or Stannis sails from 
Dragonstone? I ask for an army and my father sends me a dwarf. The king names the Hand, with the 
consent of council. Joffrey named our lord father." 
"And our lord father named me." 
"He cannot do that. Not without Joff's consent." 
"Lord Tywin is at Harrenhal with his host, if you'd care to take it up with him," Tyrion said politely. "My 
lords, perchance you would permit me a private word with my sister?" 
Varys slithered to his feet, smiling in that unctuous way he had. "How you must have yearned for the 
sound of your sweet sister's voice. My lords, please, let us give them a few moments together. The woes 
of our troubled realm shall keep." 
Janos Slynt rose hesitantly and Grand Maester Pycelle ponderously, yet they rose. Littlefinger was the 
last. "Shall I tell the steward to prepare chambers in Maegor's Holdfast?" 
"My thanks, Lord Petyr, but I will be taking Lord Stark's former quarters in the Tower of the Hand." 
Littlefinger laughed. "You're a braver man than me, Lannister. You do know the fate of our last two 
Hands?" 
"Two? If you mean to frighten me, why not say four?" 
Page 32

"Four?" Littlefinger raised an eyebrow. "Did the Hands before Lord Arryn meet some dire end in the 
Tower? I'm afraid I was too young to pay them much mind." 
"Aerys Targaryen's last Hand was killed during the Sack of King's Landing, though I doubt he'd had 
time to settle into the Tower. He was only Hand for a fortnight. The one before him was burned to death. 
And 
before them came two others who died landless and penniless in exile, and counted themselves lucky. I 
believe my lord father was the last Hand to depart King's Landing with his name, properties, and parts all 
intact." 
"Fascinating," said Littlefinger. "And all the more reason I'd sooner bed down in the dungeon." 
Perhaps you'll get that wish, Tyrion thought, but he said, "Courage and folly are cousins, or so I've 
heard. Whatever curse may linger over the Tower of the Hand, I pray I'm small enough to escape its 
notice." 
Janos Slynt laughed, Littlefinger smiled, and Grand Maester Pycelle followed them both out, bowing 
gravely. 
"I hope Father did not send you all this way to plague us with history lessons," his sister said when they 
were alone. 
"How I have yearned for the sound of your sweet voice," Tyrion sighed to her. 
"How I have yearned to have that eunuch's tongue pulled out with hot pincers," Cersei replied. "Has 
father lost his senses? Or did you forge this letter?" She read it once more, with mounting annoyance. 
"Why would he inflict you on me? I wanted him to come himself." She crushed Lord Tywin's letter in her 
fingers. "I am Joffrey's regent, and I sent him a royal command!" 
"And he ignored you," Tyrion pointed out. "He has quite a large army, he can do that. Nor is he the first. 
Is he?" 
Cersei's mouth tightened. He could see her color rising. "If I name this letter a forgery and tell them to 
throw you in a dungeon, no one will ignore that, I promise you." 
He was walking on rotten ice now, Tyrion knew. One false step and he would plunge through. "No 
one," he agreed amiably, "least of all our father. The one with the army. But why should you want to 
throw me into a dungeon, sweet sister, when I've come all this long way to help you? " 
"I do not require your help. It was our father's presence that I commanded." 
"Yes," he said quietly, "but it's Jaime you want." 
His sister fancied herself subtle, but he had grown up with her. He could read her face like one of his 
favorite books, and what he read now was rage, and fear, and despair. "Jaime-" 
"-is my brother no less than yours," Tyrion interrupted. "Give me your support and I promise you, we 
will have Jaime freed and returned to us unharmed." 
"How?" Cersei demanded. "The Stark boy and his mother are not like to forget that we beheaded Lord 
Page 33

Eddard." 
"True," Tyrion agreed, "yet you still hold his daughters, don't you? I saw the older girl out in the yard 
with Joffrey." 
"Sansa," the queen said. "I've given it out that I have the younger brat as well, but it's a lie. I sent Meryn 
Trant to take her in hand when Robert died, but her wretched dancing master interfered and the girl fled. 
No one has seen her since. Likely she's dead. A great many people died that day." 
Tyrion had hoped for both Stark girls, but he supposed one would have to do. "Tell me about our 
friends on the council." 
His sister glanced at the door. "What of them?" 
"Father seems to have taken a dislike to them. When I left him, he was wondering how their heads might 
look on the wall beside Lord Stark's." He leaned forward across the table. "Are you certain of their 
loyalty? Do you trust them?" 
"I trust no one," Cersei snapped. "I need them. Does Father believe they are playing us false?" 
"Suspects, rather." 
"Why? What does he know?" 
Tyrion shrugged. "He knows that your son's short reign has been a long parade of follies and disasters. 
That suggests that someone is giving Joffrey some very bad counsel." 
Cersei gave him a searching look. "Joff has had no lack of good counsel. He's always been 
strong-willed. Now that he's king, he believes he should do as he pleases, not as he's bid." 
"Crowns do queer things to the heads beneath them," Tyrion agreed. "This business with Eddard Stark . 
. . Joffrey's work? " 
The queen grimaced. "He was instructed to pardon Stark, to allow him to take the black. The man 
would have been out of our way forever, and we might have made peace with that son of his, but Joff 
took it upon himself to give the mob a better show. What was I to do? He called for Lord Eddard's head 
in front of half the city. And Janos Slynt and Ser Ilyn went ahead blithely and shortened the man without a 
word from me!" Her hand tightened into a fist. "The High Septon claims we profaned Baelor's Sept with 
blood, after lying to him about our intent." 
"It would seem he has a point," said Tyrion. "So this Lord Slynt, he was part of it, was he? Tell me, 
whose fine notion was it to grant him Harrenhal and name him to the council?" 
"Littlefinger made the arrangements. We needed Slynt's gold cloaks. Eddard Stark was plotting with 
Renly and he'd written to Lord Stannis, offering him the throne. We might have lost all. Even so, it was a 
close thing. If Sansa hadn't come to me and told me all her father's plans . . ." 
Tyrion was surprised. "Truly? His own daughter?" Sansa had always seemed such a sweet child, tender 
and courteous. 
"The girl was wet with love. She would have done anything for Joffrey, until he cut off her father's head 
Page 34

and called it mercy. That put an end to that." 
"His Grace has a unique way of winning the hearts of his subjects," Tyrion said with a crooked smile. 
"Was it Joffrey's wish to dismiss Ser Barristan Selmy from his Kingsguard too?" 
Cersei sighed. "Joff wanted someone to blame for Robert's death. Varys suggested Ser Barristan. Why 
not? It gave Jaime command of the Kingsguard and a seat on the small council, and allowed Joff to throw 
a bone to his dog. He is very fond of Sandor Clegane. We were prepared to offer Selmy some land and 
a towerhouse, more than the useless old fool deserved." 
"I hear that useless old fool slew two of Slynt's gold cloaks when they tried to seize him at the Mud 
Gate." 
His sister looked very unhappy. "Janos should have sent more men. He is not as competent as might be 
wished." 
"Ser Barristan was the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard," Tyrion reminded her 
pointedly. "He and Jaime are the only survivors of Aerys Targaryen's seven. The smallfolk talk of him in 
the same way they talk of Serwyn of the Mirror Shield and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight. What do 
you imagine they'll think when they see Barristan the Bold riding beside Robb Stark or Stannis 
Baratheon?" 
Cersei glanced away. "I had not considered that." 
"Father did," said Tyrion. "That is why he sent me. To put an end to these follies and bring your son to 
heel." 
"Joff will be no more tractable for you than for me." 
"He might." 
"Why should he?" 
"He knows you would never hurt him." 
Cersei's eyes narrowed. "If you believe I'd ever allow you to harm my son, you're sick with fever." 
Tyrion sighed. She'd missed the point, as she did so often. "Joffrey is as safe with me as he is with you," 
he assured her, "but so long as the boy feels threatened, he'll be more inclined to listen." He took her 
hand. "I am your brother, you know. You need me, whether you care to admit it or no. Your son needs 
me, if he's to have a hope of retaining that ugly iron chair." 
His sister seemed shocked that he would touch her. "You have always been cunning." 
"In my own small way." He grinned. 
"It may be worth the trying . . . but make no mistake, Tyrion. If I accept you, you shall be the King's 
Hand in name, but my Hand in truth. 
You will share all your plans and intentions with me before you act, and you will do nothing without my 
consent. Do you understand?" 
Page 35

"Oh, yes." 
"Do you agree?" 
"Certainly," he lied. "I am yours, sister." For as long as I need to be. "So, now that we are of one 
purpose, we ought have no more secrets between us. You say Joffrey had Lord Eddard killed, Varys 
dismissed Ser Barristan, and Littlefinger gifted us with Lord Slynt. Who murdered Jon Arryn? " 
Cersei yanked her hand back. "How should I know?" 
"The grieving widow in the Eyrie seems to think it was me. Where did she come by that notion, I 
wonder?" 
"I'm sure I don't know. That fool Eddard Stark accused me of the same thing. He hinted that Lord Arryn 
suspected or . . . well, believed 
"That you were fucking our sweet Jaime?" 
She slapped him. 
"Did you think I was as blind as Father?" Tyrion rubbed his cheek. "Who you lie with is no matter to me 
. . . although it doesn't seem quite just that you should open your legs for one brother and not the other." 
She slapped him. 
"Be gentle, Cersei, I'm only jesting with you. If truth be told, I'd sooner have a nice whore. I never 
understood what Jaime saw in you, apart from his own reflection." 
She slapped him. 
His cheeks were red and burning, yet he smiled. "If you keep doing that, I may get angry." 
That stayed her hand. "Why should I care if you do?" 
"I have some new friends," Tyrion confessed. "You won't like them at all. How did you kill Robert?" 
"He did that himself. All we did was help. When Lancel saw that Robert was going after boar, he gave 
him strongwine. His favorite sour red, but fortified, three times as potent as he was used to. The great 
stinking fool loved it. He could have stopped swilling it down anytime he cared to, but no, he drained one 
skin and told Lancel to fetch another. The boar did the rest. You should have been at the feast, Tyrion. 
There has never been a boar so delicious. They cooked it with mushrooms and apples, and it tasted like 
triumph." 
"Truly, sister, you were born to be a widow." Tyrion had rather liked Robert Baratheon, great blustering 
oaf that he was . . . doubtless in part because his sister loathed him so. "Now, if you are done slapping 
me, I will be off." He twisted his legs around and clambered down awkwardly from the chair. 
Cersei frowned. "I haven't given you leave to depart. I want to know how you intend to free Jaime." 
"I'll tell you when I know. Schemes are like fruit, they require a certain ripening. Right now, I have a 
Page 36

mind to ride through the streets and take the measure of this city." Tyrion rested his hand on the head of 
the sphinx beside the door. "One parting request. Kindly make certain no harm comes to Sansa Stark. it 
would not do to lose both the daughters." 
Outside the council chamber, Tyrion nodded to Ser Mandon and made his way down the long vaulted 
hall. Bronn fell in beside him. Of Timett son of Timett there was no sign. "Where's our red hand?" Tyrion 
asked. 
"He felt an urge to explore. His kind was not made for waiting about in halls." 
"I hope he doesn't kill anyone important." The clansmen Tyrion had brought down from their fastnesses 
in the Mountains of the Moon were loyal in their own fierce way, but they were proud and quarrelsome 
as well, prone to answer insults real or imagined with steel. "Try to find him. And while you are at it, see 
that the rest have been quartered and fed. I want them in the barracks beneath the Tower of the Hand, 
but don't let the steward put the Stone Crows near the Moon Brothers, and tell him the Burned Men 
must have a hall all to themselves." 
"Where will you be?" 
"I'm riding back to the Broken Anvil." 
Bronn grinned insolently. "Need an escort? The talk is, the streets are dangerous." 
"I'll call upon the captain of my sister's household guard, and remind him that I am no less a Lannister 
than she is. He needs to recall that his oath is to Casterly Rock, not to Cersei or Joffrey." 
An hour later, Tyrion rode from the Red Keep accompanied by a dozen Lannister guardsmen in crimson 
cloaks and lion-crested halffielms. As they passed beneath the portcullis, he noted the heads mounted 
atop the walls. Black with rot and old tar, they had long since become unrecognizable. "Captain Vylarr," 
he called, "I want those taken down on the morrow. Give them to the silent sisters for cleaning." It would 
be hell to match them with the bodies, he supposed, yet it must be done. Even in the midst of war certain 
decencies needed to be observed. 
Vylarr grew hesitant. "His Grace has told us he wishes the traitors' heads to remain on the walls until he 
fills those last three empty spikes there on the end." 
"Let me hazard a wild stab. One is for Robb Stark, the others for Lords Stannis and Renly. Would that 
be right?" 
"Yes, my lord." 
"My nephew is thirteen years old today, Vylarr. Try and recall that. I'll 
have the heads down on the morrow, or one of those empty spikes may have a different lodger. Do you 
take my meaning, Captain?" 
"I'll see that they're taken down myself, my lord." 
"Good." Tyrion put his heels into his horse and trotted away, leaving the red cloaks to follow as best 
they could. 
Page 37

He had told Cersei he intended to take the measure of the city. That was not entirely a lie. Tyrion 
Lannister was not pleased by much of what he saw. The streets of King's Landing had always been 
teeming and raucous and noisy, but now they reeked of danger in a way that he did not recall from past 
visits. A naked corpse sprawled in the gutter near the Street of Looms, being torn at by a pack of feral 
dogs, yet no one seemed to care. Watchmen were much in evidence, moving in pairs through the alleys in 
their gold cloaks and shirts of black ringmail, iron cudgels never far from their hands. The markets were 
crowded with ragged men selling their household goods for any price they could get . . . and 
conspicuously empty of farmers selling food. What little produce he did see was three times as costly as it 
had been a year ago. one peddler was hawking rats roasted on a skewer. "Fresh rats," he cried loudly, 
"fresh rats." Doubtless fresh rats were to be preferred to old stale rotten rats. The frightening thing was, 
the rats looked more appetizing than most of what the butchers were selling. on the Street of Flour, 
Tyrion saw guards at every other shop door. When times grew lean, even bakers found sellswords 
cheaper than bread, he reflected. 
"There is no food coming in, is there?" he said to Vylarr. 
"Little enough," the captain admitted. "With the war in the riverlands and Lord Renly raising rebels in 
Highgarden, the roads are closed to south and west." 
"And what has my good sister done about this?" 
"She is taking steps to restore the king's peace," Vylarr assured him. "Lord Slynt has tripled the size of 
the City Watch, and the queen has put a thousand craftsmen to work on our defenses. The stonemasons 
are strengthening the walls, carpenters are building scorpions and catapults by the hundred, fletchers are 
making arrows, the smiths are forging blades, and the Alchemists' Guild has pledged ten thousand jars of 
wildfire." 
Tyrion shifted uncomfortably in his saddle. He was pleased that Cersei had not been idle, but wildfire 
was treacherous stuff, and ten thousand jars were enough to turn all of King's Landing into cinders. 
"Where has my sister found the coin to pay for all of this?" it was no secret that King Robert had left the 
crown vastly in debt, and alchemists were seldom mistaken for altruists. 
"Lord Littlefinger always finds a way, my lord. He has imposed a tax on those wishing to enter the city." 
"Yes, that would work," Tyrion said, thinking, Clever. Clever and cruel. Tens of thousands had fled the 
fighting for the supposed safety of King's Landing. He had seen them on the kingsroad, troupes of 
mothers and children and anxious fathers who had gazed on his horses and wagons with covetous eyes. 
Once they reached the city they would doubtless pay over all they had to put those high comforting walls 
between them and the war . . . though they might think twice if they knew about the wildfire. 
The inn beneath the sign of the broken anvil stood within sight of those walls, near the Gate of the Gods 
where they had entered that morning. As they rode into its courtyard, a boy ran out to help Tyrion down 
from his horse. "Take your men back to the castle," he told Vylarr. "I'll be spending the night here." 
The captain looked dubious. "Will you be safe, my lord?" 
"Well, as to that, Captain, when I left the inn this morning it was full of Black Ears. One is never quite 
safe when Chella daughter of Cheyk is about." Tyrion waddled toward the door, leaving Vylarr to puzzle 
at his meaning. 
A gust of merriment greeted him as he shoved into the inn's common room. He recognized Chella's 
Page 38

throaty chuckle and the lighter music of Shae's laughter. The girl was seated by the hearth, sipping wine at 
a round wooden table with three of the Black Ears he'd left to guard her and a plump man whose back 
was to him. The innkeeper, he assumed . . . until Shae called Tyrion by name and the intruder rose. "My 
good lord, I am so pleased to see you," he gushed, a soft eunuch's smile on his powdered face. 
Tyrion stumbled. "Lord Varys. I had not thought to see you here." The Others take him, how did he find 
them so quickly? 
"Forgive me if I intrude," Varys said. "I was taken by a sudden urge to meet your young lady." 
"Young lady," Shae repeated, savoring the words. "You're half right, m'lord. I'm young." 
Eighteen, Tyrion thought. Eighteen, and a whore, but quick of wit, nimble as a cat between the sheets, 
with large dark eyes and fine black hair and a sweet, soft, hungry little mouth . . . and mine! Damn you, 
eunuch. "I fear I'm the intruder, Lord Varys," he said with forced courtesy. "When I came in, you were in 
the midst of some merriment." 
"M'lord Varys complimented Chella on her ears and said she must have killed many men to have such a 
fine necklace," Shae explained. It grated on him to hear her call Varys m'lord in that tone; that was what 
she called him in their pillow play. "And Chella told him only cowards kill the vanquished." 
"Braver to leave the man alive, with a chance to cleanse his shame by 
winning back his ear," explained Chella, a small dark woman whose grisly neckware was hung with no 
less than forty-six dried, wrinkled ears. Tyrion had counted them once. "Only so can you prove you do 
not fear your enemies." 
Shae hooted. "And then m'lord says if he was a Black Ear he'd never sleep, for dreams of one-eared 
men." 
"A problem I will never need face," Tyrion said. "I'm terrified of my enemies, so I kill them all." 
Varys giggled. "Will you take some wine with us, my lord?" 
"I'll take some wine." Tyrion seated himself beside Shae. He understood what was happening here, if 
Chella and the girl did not. Varys was delivering a message. When he said, I was taken by a sudden urge 
to meet your young lady, what he meant was, You tried to hide her, but I knew where she was, and who 
she was, and here I am. He wondered who had betrayed him. The innkeeper, that boy in the stable, a 
guard on the gate . . . or one of his own? 
"I always like to return to the city through the Gate of the Gods," Varys told Shae as he filled the wine 
cups. "The carvings on the gatehouse are exquisite, they make me weep each time I see them. The eyes . 
. . so expressive, don't you think? They almost seem to follow you as you ride beneath the portcullis." 
"I never noticed, m'lord," Shae replied. "I'll look again on the morrow, if it please you." 
Don't bother, sweetling, Tyrion thought, swirling the wine in the cup. He cares not a whit about carvings. 
The eyes he boasts of are his own. What he means is that he was watching, that he knew we were here 
the moment we passed through the gates. 
"Do be careful, child," Varys urged. "King's Landing is not wholly safe these days. I know these streets 
Page 39

well, and yet I almost feared to come today, alone and unarmed as I was. Lawless men are everywhere 
in this dark time, oh, yes. Men with cold steel and colder hearts." Where I can come alone and unarmed, 
others can come with swords in their fists, he was saying. 
Shae only laughed. "If they try and bother me, they'll be one ear short when Chella runs them off." 
Varys hooted as if that was the funniest thing he had ever heard, but there was no laughter in his eyes 
when he turned them on Tyrion. "Your young lady has an amiable way to her. I should take very good 
care of her if I were you." 
"I intend to. Any man who tries to harm her-well, I'm too small to be a Black Ear, and I make no claims 
to courage." See? I speak the same tongue you do, eunuch. Hurt her, and I'll have your head. 
"I will leave you." Varys rose. "I know how weary you must be. I only 
wished to welcome you, my lord, and tell you how very pleased I am by your arrival. We have dire need 
of you on the council. Have you seen the comet? " 
"I'm short, not blind," Tyrion said. Out on the kingsroad, it had seemed to cover half the sky, outshining 
the crescent moon. 
"In the streets, they call it the Red Messenger," Varys said. "They say it comes as a herald before a king, 
to warn of fire and blood to follow." The eunuch rubbed his powdered hands together. "May I leave you 
with a bit of a riddle, Lord Tyrion?" He did not wait for an answer. "In a room sit three great men, a king, 
a priest, and a rich man with his gold. Between them stands a sellsword, a little man of common birth and 
no great mind. Each of the great ones bids him slay the other two. 'Do it' says the king, 'for I am your 
lawful ruler.' 'Do it' says the priest, 'for I command you in the names of the gods.' 'Do it' says the rich 
man, 'and all this gold shall be yours.' So tell me-who lives and who dies?" Bowing deeply, the eunuch 
hurried from the common room on soft slippered feet. 
When he was gone, Chella gave a snort and Shae wrinkled up her pretty face. "The rich man lives. 
Doesn't he?" 
Tyrion sipped at his wine, thoughtful. "Perhaps. Or not. That would depend on the sellsword, it seems." 
He set down his cup. "Come, let's go upstairs." 
She had to wait for him at the top of the steps, for her legs were slim and supple while his were short 
and stunted and full of aches. But she was smiling when he reached her. "Did you miss me?" she teased 
as she took his hand. 
"Desperately," Tyrion admitted. Shae only stood a shade over five feet, yet still he must look up to her . . 
. but in her case he found he did not mind. She was sweet to look up at. 
"You'll miss me all the time in your Red Keep," she said as she led him to her room. "All alone in your 
cold bed in your Tower of the Hand." 
"Too true." Tyrion would gladly have kept her with him, but his lord father had forbidden it. You will not 
take the whore to court, Lord Tywin had commanded. Bringing her to the city was as much defiance as 
he dared. All his authority derived from his father, the girl had to understand that. "You won't be far," he 
promised. "You'll have a house, with guards and servants, and I'll visit as often as I'm able." 
Page 40

Shae kicked shut the door. Through the cloudy panes of the narrow window, he could make out the 
Great Sept of Baelor crowning Visenya's Hill but Tyrion was distracted by a different sight. Bending, 
Shae took her gown by the hem, drew it over her head, and tossed it aside. She did not believe in 
smallclothes. "You'll never be able to rest," she said as she 
stood before him, pink and nude and lovely, one hand braced on her hip. "You'll think of me every time 
you go to bed. Then you'll get hard and you'll have no one to help you and you'll never be able to sleep 
unless you"-she grinned that wicked grin Tyrion liked so well-"is that why they call it the Tower of the 
Hand, m'lord?" 
"Be quiet and kiss me," he commanded. 
He could taste the wine on her lips, and feel her small firm breasts pressed against him as her fingers 
moved to the lacings of his breeches. "My lion," she whispered when he broke off the kiss to undress. 
"My sweet lord, my giant of Lannister." Tyrion pushed her toward the bed. When he entered her, she 
screamed loud enough to wake Baelor the Blessed in his tomb, and her nails left gouges in his back. He'd 
never had a pain he liked half so well. 
Fool, he thought to himself afterward, as they lay in the center of the sagging mattress amidst the rumpled 
sheets. Will you never learn, dwarf? She's a whore, damn you, it's your coin she loves, not your cock. 
Remember Tysha? Yet when his fingers trailed lightly over one nipple, it stiffened at the touch, and he 
could see the mark on her breast where he'd bitten her in his passion. 
"So what will you do, m'lord, now that you're the Hand of the King?" Shae asked him as he cupped that 
warm sweet flesh. 
"Something Cersei will never expect," Tyrion murmured softly against her slender neck. "I'll do . . . 
justice." 
CHAPTER 4 
BRAN 
Bran preferred the hard stone of the window seat to the comforts of his featherbed and blankets. Abed, 
the walls pressed close and the ceiling hung heavy above him; abed, the room was his cell, and Winterfell 
his prison. Yet outside his window, the wide world still called. 
He could not walk, nor climb nor hunt nor fight with a wooden sword as once he had, but he could still 
look. He liked to watch the windows begin to glow all over Winterfell as candles and hearth fires were lit 
behind the diamond-shaped panes of tower and hall, and he loved to listen to the direwolves sing to the 
stars. 
Of late, he often dreamed of wolves. They are talking to me, brother to brother, he told himself when the 
direwolves howled. He could almost understand them . . . not quite, not truly, but almost . . . as if they 
were singing in a language he had once known and somehow forgotten. The Walders might be scared of 
them, but the Starks had wolf blood. Old Nan told him so. "Though it is stronger in some than in others," 
she warned. 
Page 41

Summer's howls were long and sad, full of grief and longing. Shaggydog's were more savage. Their 
voices echoed through the yards and halls until the castle rang and it seemed as though some great pack 
of direwolves haunted Winterfell, instead of only two . . . two where there had once been six. Do they 
miss their brothers and sisters too? Bran wondered. Are they calling to Grey Wind and Ghost, to 
Nymeria 
and Lady's Shade? Do they want them to come home and be a pack together? 
"Who can know the mind of a wolf?" Ser Rodrik Cassel said when Bran asked him why they howled. 
Bran's lady mother had named him castellan of Winterfell in her absence, and his duties left him little time 
for idle questions. 
"It's freedom they're calling for," declared Farlen, who was kennelmaster and had no more love for the 
direwolves than his hounds did. "They don't like being walled up, and who's to blame them? Wild things 
belong in the wild, not in a castle." 
"They want to hunt," agreed Gage the cook as he tossed cubes of suet in a great kettle of stew. "A wolf 
smells better'n any man. Like as not, they've caught the scent o' prey." 
Maester Luwin did not think so. "Wolves often howl at the moon. These are howling at the comet. See 
how bright it is, Bran? Perchance they think it is the moon." 
When Bran repeated that to Osha, she laughed aloud. "Your wolves have more wit than your maester," 
the wildling woman said. "They know truths the grey man has forgotten." The way she said it made him 
shiver, and when he asked what the comet meant, she answered, "Blood and fire, boy, and nothing 
sweet." 
Bran asked Septon Chayle about the comet while they were sorting through some scrolls snatched from 
the library fire. "It is the sword that slays the season," he replied, and soon after the white raven came 
from Oldtown bringing word of autumn, so doubtless he was right. 
Though Old Nan did not think so, and she'd lived longer than any of them. "Dragons," she said, lifting her 
head and sniffing. She was near blind and could not see the comet, yet she claimed she could smell it. "It 
be dragons, boy," she insisted. Bran got no princes from Nan, no more than he ever had. 
Hodor said only, "Hodor." That was all he ever said. 
And still the direwolves howled. The guards on the walls muttered curses, hounds in the kennels barked 
furiously, horses kicked at their stalls, the Walders shivered by their fire, and even Maester Luwin 
complained of sleepless nights. Only Bran did not mind. Ser Rodrik had confined the wolves to the 
godswood after Shaggydog bit Little Walder, but the stones of Winterfell played queer tricks with sound, 
and sometimes it sounded as if they were in the yard right below Bran's window. Other times he would 
have sworn they were up on the curtain walls, loping round like sentries. He wished that he could see 
them. 
He could see the comet hanging above the Guards Hall and the Bell Tower, and farther back the First 
Keep, squat and round, its gargoyles black shapes against the bruised purple dusk. Once Bran had 
known 
every stone of those buildings, inside and out; he had climbed them all, scampering up walls as easily as 
Page 42

other boys ran down stairs. Their rooftops had been his secret places, and the crows atop the broken 
tower his special friends. 
And then he had fallen. 
Bran did not remember falling, yet they said he had, so he supposed it must be true. He had almost died. 
When he saw the weatherworn gargoyles atop the First Keep where it had happened, he got a queer 
tight feeling in his belly. And now he could not climb, nor walk nor run nor swordfight, and the dreams 
he'd dreamed of knighthood had soured in his head. 
Summer had howled the day Bran had fallen, and for long after as he lay broken in his bed; Robb had 
told him so before he went away to war. Summer had mourned for him, and Shaggydog and Grey Wind 
had joined in his grief. And the night the bloody raven had brought word of their father's death, the 
wolves had known that too. Bran had been in the maester's turret with Rickon talking of the children of 
the forest when Summer and Shaggydog had drowned out Luwin with their howls. 
Who are they mourning now? Had some enemy slain the King in the 
North, who used to be his brother Robb? Had his bastard brother Jon 
Snow fallen from the Wall? Had his mother died, or one of his sisters? Or 
was this something else, as maester and septon and Old Nan seemed to 
think? 
If I were truly a direwolf, I would understand the song, he thought wistfully. In his wolf dreams, he could 
race up the sides of mountains, jagged icy mountains taller than any tower, and stand at the summit 
beneath the full moon with all the world below him, the way it used to be. 
"Oooo," Bran cried tentatively. He cupped his hands around his mouth and lifted his head to the comet. 
"Ooooooooooooooooooo, ahooooooooooooooo, " he howled. it sounded stupid, high and hollow and 
quavering, a little boy's howl, not a wolf's. Yet Summer gave answer, his deep voice drowning out Bran's 
thin one, and Shaggydog made it a chorus. Bran haroooed again. They howled together, last of their 
pack. 
The noise brought a guard to his door, Hayhead with the wen on his nose. He peered in, saw Bran 
howling out the window, and said, "What's this, my prince?" 
It made Bran feel queer when they called him prince, though he was Robb's heir, and Robb was King in 
the North now. He turned his head to howl at the guard. "Oooooooo. Oo-oo-oooooooooooo. " 
Hayhead screwed up his face. "Now you stop that there." 
"0oo-0oo-0ooooo. 0oo-0oo-0oooooooooooooooo. " 
The guardsman retreated. When he came back, Maester Luwin was with him, all in grey, his chain tight 
about his neck. "Bran, those beasts make sufficient noise without your help." He crossed the room and 
put his hand on the boy's brow. "The hour grows late, you ought to be fast asleep." 
"I'm talking to the wolves." Bran brushed the hand away. 
Page 43

"Shall I have Hayhead carry you to your bed?" 
"I can get to bed myself." Mikken had hammered a row of iron bars into the wall, so Bran could pull 
himself about the room with his arms. It was slow and hard and it made his shoulders ache, but he hated 
being carried. "Anyway, I don't have to sleep if I don't want to." 
"All men must sleep, Bran. Even princes." 
"When I sleep I turn into a wolf." Bran turned his face away and looked back out into the night. "Do 
wolves dream?" 
"All creatures dream, I think, yet not as men do." 
"Do dead men dream?" Bran asked, thinking of his father. In the dark crypts below Winterfell, a 
stonemason was chiseling out his father's likeness in granite. 
"Some say yes, some no," the maester answered. "The dead themselves are silent on the matter." 
"Do trees dream?" 
"Trees? No . . ." 
"They do," Bran said with sudden certainty. "They dream tree dreams. I dream of a tree sometimes. A 
weirwood, like the one in the godswood. It calls to me. The wolf dreams are better. I smell things, and 
sometimes I can taste the blood." 
Maester Luwin tugged at his chain where it chafed his neck. "If you would only spend more time with the 
other children-" 
"I hate the other children," Bran said, meaning the Walders. "I commanded you to send them away." 
Luwin grew stern. "The Freys are your lady mother's wards, sent here to be fostered at her express 
command. It is not for you to expel them, nor is it kind. If we turned them out, where would they go?" 
"Home. It's their fault you won't let me have Summer." 
"The Frey boy did not ask to be attacked," the maester said, "no more than I did." 
"That was Shaggydog." Rickon's big black wolf was so wild he even frightened Bran at times. "Summer 
never bit anyone." 
"Summer ripped out a man's throat in this very chamber, or have you forgotten? The truth is, those sweet 
pups you and your brothers found in the snow have grown into dangerous beasts. The Frey boys are 
wise to be wary of them." 
"We should put the Walders in the godswood. They could play lord of the crossing all they want, and 
Summer could sleep with me again. If I'm the prince, why won't you heed me? I wanted to ride Dancer, 
but Alebelly wouldn't let me past the gate." 
"And rightly so. The wolfswood is full of danger; your last ride should have taught you that. Would you 
Page 44

want some outlaw to take you captive and sell you to the Lannisters?" 
"Summer would save me," Bran insisted stubbornly. "Princes should be allowed to sail the sea and hunt 
boar in the wolfswood and joust with lances." 
"Bran, child, why do you torment yourself so? One day you may do some of these things, but now you 
are only a boy of eight." 
"I'd sooner be a wolf. Then I could live in the wood and sleep when I wanted, and I could find Arya and 
Sansa. I'd smell where they were and go save them, and when Robb went to battle I'd fight beside him 
like Grey Wind. I'd tear out the Kingslayer's throat with my teeth, rip, and then the war would be over 
and everyone would come back to Winterfell. If I was a wolf . . . " He howled. 
"Ooo-ooo-oooooooooooo. 
Luwin raised his voice. "A true prince would welcorne-" 
"AAHOOOOOOO," Bran howled, louder. "AAH000000000000" 
The maester surrendered. "As you will, child." With a look that was part grief and part disgust, he left the 
bedchamber. 
Howling lost its savor once Bran was alone. After a time he quieted. I did welcome them, he told 
himself, resentful. I was the lord in Winterfell, a true lord, he can't say I wasn't. When the Walders had 
arrived from the Twins, it had been Rickon who wanted them gone. A baby of four, he had screamed 
that he wanted Mother and Father and Robb, not these strangers. It had been up to Bran to soothe him 
and bid the Freys welcome. He had offered them meat and mead and a seat by the fire, and even 
Maester Luwin had said afterward that he'd done well. 
Only that was before the game. 
The game was played with a log, a staff, a body of water, and a great deal of shouting. The water was 
the most important, Walder and Walder assured Bran. You could use a plank or even a series of stones, 
and a branch could be your staff. You didn't have to shout. But without water, there was no game. As 
Maester Luwin and Ser Rodrik were not about to let the children go wandering off into the wolfswood in 
search of a stream, they made do with one of the murky pools in the godswood. Walder and Walder had 
never seen hot water bubbling from the ground before, but they both allowed how it would make the 
game even better. 
Both of them were called Walder Frey. Big Walder said there were 
bunches of Walders at the Twins, all named after the boys' grandfather, Lord Walder Frey. "We have 
our own names at Winterfell," Rickon told them haughtily when he heard that. 
The way their game was played, you laid the log across the water, and one player stood in the middle 
with the stick. He was the lord of the crossing, and when one of the other players came up, he had to 
say, "I am the lord of the crossing, who goes there?" And the other player had to make up a speech 
about who they were and why they should be allowed to cross. The lord could make them swear oaths 
and answer questions. They didn't have to tell the truth, but the oaths were binding unless they said 
"Maybaps," so the trick was to say "Mayhaps" so the lord of the crossing didn't notice. Then you could 
try and knock the lord into the water and you got to be lord of the crossing, but only if you'd said 
"Mayhaps." Otherwise you were out of the game. The lord got to knock anyone in the water anytime he 
Page 45

pleased, and he was the only one who got to use a stick. 
In practice, the game seemed to come down to mostly shoving, hitting, and falling into the water, along 
with a lot of loud arguments about whether or not someone had said "Mayhaps." Little Walder was lord 
of the crossing more often than not. 
He was Little Walder even though he was tall and stout, with a red face and a big round belly. Big 
Walder was sharp-faced and skinny and half a foot shorter. "He's fifty-two days older than me," Little 
Walder explained, "so he was bigger at first, but I grew faster." 
"We're cousins, not brothers," added Big Walder, the little one. "I'm Walder son of Jammos. My father 
was Lord Walder's son by his fourth wife. He's Walder son of Merrett. His grandmother was Lord 
Walder's third wife, the Crakehall. He's ahead of me in the line of succession even though I'm older." 
"Only by fifty-two days," Little Walder objected. "And neither of us will ever hold the Twins, stupid." 
"I will," Big Walder declared. "We're not the only Walders either. Ser Stevron has a grandson, Black 
Walder, he's fourth in line of succession, and there's Red Walder, Ser Emmon's son, and Bastard 
Walder, who isn't in the line at all. He's called Walder Rivers not Walder Frey. Plus there's girls named 
Walda." 
"And Tyr. You always forget Tyr." 
"He's Waltyr, not Walder," Big Walder said airily. "And he's after us, so he doesn't matter. Anyhow, I 
never liked him." 
Ser Rodrik decreed that they would share Jon Snow's old bedchamber, since Jon was in the Night's 
Watch and never coming back. Bran hated that; it made him feel as if the Freys were trying to steal Jon's 
place. 
He had watched wistfully while the Walders contested with Turnip the cook's boy and Joseth's girls 
Bandy and Shyra. The Walders had decreed that Bran should be the judge and decide whether or not 
people had said "Maybaps," but as soon as they started playing they forgot all about him. 
The shouts and splashes soon drew others: Palla the kennel girl, Cayn's boy Calon, TomToo whose 
father Fat Tom had died with Bran's father at King's Landing. Before very long, every one of them was 
soaked and muddy. Palla was brown from head to heel, with moss in her hair, breathless from laughter. 
Bran had not heard so much laughing since the night the bloody raven came. If I had my legs, I'd knock 
all of them into the water, he thought bitterly. No one would ever be lord of the crossing but me. 
Finally Rickon came running into the godswood, Shaggydog at his heels. He watched Turnip and Little 
Walder struggle for the stick until Turnip lost his footing and went in with a huge splash, arms waving. 
Rickon yelled, "Me! Me now! I want to play!" Little Walder beckoned him on, and Shaggydog started to 
follow. "No, Shaggy," his brother commanded. "Wolves can't play. You stay with Bran." And he did . . . 
. . . until Little Walder had smacked Rickon with the stick, square across his belly. Before Bran could 
blink, the black wolf was flying over the plank, there was blood in the water, the Walders were shrieking 
red murder, Rickon sat in the mud laughing, and Hodor came lumbering in shouting "Hodor! Hodor! 
Hodor!" 
After that, oddly, Rickon decided he liked the Walders. They never played lord of the crossing again, 
Page 46

but they played other games-monsters and maidens, rats and cats, come-into-my-castle, all sorts of 
things. With Rickon by their side, the Walders plundered the kitchens for pies and honeycombs, raced 
round the walls, tossed bones to the pups in the kennels, and trained with wooden swords under Ser 
Rodrik's sharp eye. Rickon even showed them the deep vaults under the earth where the stonemason 
was carving father's tomb. "You had no right!" Bran screamed at his brother when he heard. "That was 
our place, a Stark place!" But Rickon never cared. 
The door to his bedchamber opened. Maester Luwin was carrying a green jar, and this time Osha and 
Hayhead came with him. "I've made you a sleeping draught, Bran." 
Osha scooped him up in her bony arms. She was very tall for a woman, and wiry strong. She bore him 
effortlessly to his bed. 
"This will give you dreamless sleep," Maester Luwin said as he pulled the stopper from the jar. "Sweet, 
dreamless sleep." 
"It will?" Bran said, wanting to believe. 
"Yes. Drink." 
Bran drank. The potion was thick and chalky, but there was honey in it so it went down easy. 
"Come the morn, you'll feel better." Luwin gave Bran a smile and a pat as he took his leave. 
Osha lingered behind. "Is it the wolf dreams again?" 
Bran nodded. 
"You should not fight so hard, boy. I see you talking to the heart tree. Might be the gods are trying to 
talk back." 
"The gods?" he murmured, drowsy already. Osha's face grew blurry and grey. Sweet, dreamless sleep, 
Bran thought. 
Yet when the darkness closed over him, he found himself in the godswood, moving silently beneath 
green-grey sentinels and gnarled oaks as old as time. I am walking, he thought, exulting. Part of him knew 
that it was only a dream, but even the dream of walking was better than the truth of his bedchamber, 
walls and ceiling and door. 
It was dark amongst the trees, but the comet lit his way, and his feet were sure. He was moving on four 
good legs, strong and swift, and he could feel the ground underfoot, the soft crackling of fallen leaves, 
thick roots and hard stones, the deep layers of humus. It was a good feeling. 
The smells filled his head, alive and intoxicating; the green muddy stink of the hot pools, the perfume of 
rich rotting earth beneath his paws, the squirrels in the oaks. The scent of squirrel made him remember 
the taste of hot blood and the way the bones would crack between his teeth. Slaver filled his mouth. He 
had eaten no more than half a day past, but there was no joy in dead meat, even deer. He could hear the 
squirrels chittering and rustling above him, safe among their leaves, but they knew better than to come 
down to where his brother and he were prowling. 
He could smell his brother too, a familiar scent, strong and earthy, his scent as black as his coat. His 
Page 47

brother was loping around the walls, full of fury. Round and round he went, night after day after night, 
tireless, searching . . . for prey, for a way out, for his mother, his littermates, his pack . . . searching, 
searching, and never finding. 
Behind the trees the walls rose, piles of dead man-rock that loomed all about this speck of living wood. 
Speckled grey they rose, and moss-spotted, yet thick and strong and higher than any wolf could hope to 
leap. Cold iron and splintery wood closed off the only holes through the piled stones that hemmed them 
in. His brother would stop at every hole and bare his fangs in rage, but the ways stayed closed. 
He had done the same the first night, and learned that it was no good. Snarls would open no paths here. 
Circling the walls would not push 
them back. Lifting a leg and marking the trees would keep no men away. The world had tightened 
around them, but beyond the walled wood still stood the great grey caves of man-rock. Winterfell, he 
remembered, the sound coming to him suddenly. Beyond its sky-tall man-cliffs the true world was calling, 
and he knew he must answer or die. 
CHAPTER 5 
ARYA 
They traveled dawn to dusk, past woods and orchards and neatly tended fields, through small villages, 
crowded market towns, and stout holdfasts. Come dark, they would make camp and eat by the light of 
the Red Sword. The men took turns standing watch. Arya would glimpse firelight flickering through the 
trees from the camps of other travelers. There seemed to be more camps every night, and more traffic on 
the kingsroad by day. 
Morn, noon, and night they came, old folks and little children, big men and small ones, barefoot girls and 
women with babes at their breasts. Some drove farm wagons or bumped along in the back of ox carts. 
More rode: draft horses, ponies, mules, donkeys, anything that would walk or run or roll. One woman 
led a milk cow with a little girl on its back. Arya saw a smith pushing a wheelbarrow with his tools inside, 
hammers and tongs and even an anvil, and a little while later a different man with a different wheelbarrow, 
only inside this one were two babies in a blanket. Most came on foot, with their goods on their shoulders 
and weary, wary looks upon their faces. They walked south, toward the city, toward King's Landing, 
and only one in a hundred spared so much as a word for Yoren and his charges, traveling north. She 
wondered why no one else was going the same way as them. 
Many of the travelers were armed; Arya saw daggers and dirks, scythes and axes, and here and there a 
sword. Some had made clubs from tree limbs, or carved knobby staffs. They fingered their weapons and 
gave 
lingering looks at the wagons as they rolled by, yet in the end they let the column pass. Thirty was too 
many, no matter what they had in those wagons. 
Look with your eyes, Syrio had said, listen with your ears. 
One day a madwoman began to scream at them from the side of the road. "Fools! They'll kill you, 
Page 48

fools!" She was scarecrow thin, with hollow eyes and bloody feet. 
The next morning, a sleek merchant on a grey mare reined up by Yoren and offered to buy his wagons 
and everything in them for a quarter of their worth. "It's war, they'll take what they want, you'll do better 
selling to me, my friend." Yoren turned away with a twist of his crooked shoulders, and spat. 
Arya noticed the first grave that same day; a small mound beside the road, dug for a child. A crystal had 
been set in the soft earth, and Lommy wanted to take it until the Bull told him he'd better leave the dead 
alone. A few leagues farther on, Praed pointed out more graves, a whole row freshly dug. After that, a 
day hardly passed without one. 
One time Arya woke in the dark, frightened for no reason she could name. Above, the Red Sword 
shared the sky with half a thousand stars. The night seemed oddly quiet to her, though she could hear 
Yoren's muttered snores, the crackle of the fire, even the muffled stirrings of the donkeys. Yet somehow 
it felt as though the world were holding its breath, and the silence made her shiver. She went back to 
sleep clutching Needle. 
Come morning, when Praed did not awaken, Arya realized that it had been his coughing she had missed. 
They dug a grave of their own then, burying the sellsword where he'd slept. Yoren stripped him of his 
valuables before they threw the dirt on him. One man claimed his boots, another his dagger. His mail shirt 
and helm were parceled out. His longsword Yoren handed to the Bull. "Arms like yours, might be you 
can learn to use this," he told him. A boy called Tarber tossed a handful of acorns on top of Praed's 
body, so an oak might grow to mark his place. 
That evening they stopped in a village at an ivy-covered inn. Yoren counted the coins in his purse and 
decided they had enough for a hot meal. "We'll sleep outside, same as ever, but they got a bathhouse 
here, if any of you feels the need o' hot water and a lick o' soap." 
Arya did not dare, even though she smelled as bad as Yoren by now, all sour and stinky. Some of the 
creatures living in her clothes had come all the way from Flea Bottom with her; it didn't seem right to 
drown them. Tarber and Hot Pie and the Bull joined the line of men headed for the tubs. Others settled 
down in front of the bathhouse. The rest crowded into the common room. Yoren even sent Lommy out 
with tankards for 
the three in fetters, who'd been left chained up in the back of their wagon. 
Washed and unwashed alike supped on hot pork pies and baked apples. The innkeeper gave them a 
round of beer on the house. "I had a brother took the black, years ago. Serving boy, clever, but one day 
he got seen filching pepper from m'lord's table. He liked the taste of it, is all. just a pinch o' pepper, but 
Ser Malcolm was a hard man. You get pepper on the Wall?" When Yoren shook his head, the man 
sighed. "Shame. Lync loved that pepper." 
Arya sipped at her tankard cautiously, between spoonfuls of pie still warm from the oven. Her father 
sometimes let them have a cup of beer, she remembered. Sansa used to make a face at the taste and say 
that wine was ever so much finer, but Arya had liked it well enough. it made her sad to think of Sansa 
and her father. 
The inn was full of people moving south, and the common room erupted in scorn when Yoren said they 
were traveling the other way. "You'll be back soon enough," the innkeeper vowed. "There's no going 
north. Half the fields are burnt, and what folks are left are walled up inside their holdfasts. One bunch 
rides off at dawn and another one shows up by dusk." 
Page 49

"That's nothing to us," Yoren insisted stubbornly. "Tully or Lannister, makes no matter. The Watch takes 
no part." 
Lord Tully is my grandfather, Arya thought. It mattered to her, but she chewed her lip and kept quiet, 
listening. 
"It's more than Lannister and Tully," the innkeeper said. "There's wild men down from the Mountains of 
the Moon, try telling them you take no part. And the Starks are in it too, the young lord's come down, 
the dead Hand's son . . ." 
Arya sat up straight, straining to hear. Did he mean Robb? 
"I heard the boy rides to battle on a wolf," said a yellow-haired man with a tankard in his hand. 
"Fool's talk." Yoren spat. 
"The man I heard it from, he saw it himself. A wolf big as a horse, he swore." 
"Swearing don't make it true, Hod," the innkeeper said. "You keep swearing you'll pay what you owe 
me, and I've yet to see a copper." The common room erupted in laughter, and the man with the yellow 
hair turned red. 
"It's been a bad year for wolves," volunteered a sallow man in a travelstained green cloak. "Around the 
Gods Eye, the packs have grown bolder'n anyone can remember. Sheep, cows, dogs, makes no matter, 
they kill as they like, and they got no fear of men. It's worth your life to go into those woods by night." 
"Ah, that's more tales, and no more true than the other." 
"I heard the same thing from my cousin, and she's not the sort to lie," an old woman said. "She says 
there's this great pack, hundreds of them, mankillers. The one that leads them is a she-wolf, a bitch from 
the seventh hell." 
A she-wolf. Arya sloshed her beer, wondering. Was the Gods Eye near the Trident? She wished she 
had a map. It had been near the Trident that she'd left Nymeria. She hadn't wanted to, but Jory said they 
had no choice, that if the wolf came back with them she'd be killed for biting Joffrey, even though he'd 
deserved it. They'd had to shout and scream and throw stones, and it wasn't until a few of Arya's stones 
struck home that the direwolf had finally stopped following them. She probably wouldn't even know me 
now, Arya thought. Or if she did, she'd hate me. 
The man in the green cloak said, "I heard how this hellbitch walked into a village one day . . . a market 
day, people everywhere, and she walks in bold as you please and tears a baby from his mother's arms. 
When the tale reached Lord Mooton, him and his sons swore they'd put an end to her. They tracked her 
to her lair with a pack of wolfhounds, and barely escaped with their skins. Not one of those dogs came 
back, not one." 
"That's just a story," Arya blurted out before she could stop herself. "Wolves don't eat babies." 
"And what would you know about it, lad?" asked the man in the green cloak. 
Before she could think of an answer, Yoren had her by the arm. "The boy's greensick on beer, that's all 
Page 50

it is." 
"No I'm not. They don't eat babies . . ." 
"Outside, boy . . . and see that you stay there until you learn to shut your mouth when men are talking." 
He gave her a stiff shove, toward the side door that led back to the stables. "Go on now. See that the 
stableboy has watered our horses." 
Arya went outside, stiff with fury. "They don't," she muttered, kicking at a rock as she stalked off. It 
went rolling and fetched up under the wagons. 
"Boy," a friendly voice called out. "Lovely boy." 
One of the men in irons was talking to her. Warily, Arya approached the wagon, one hand on Needle's 
hilt. 
The prisoner lifted an empty tankard, his chains rattling. "A man could use another taste of beer. A man 
has a thirst, wearing these heavy bracelets." He was the youngest of the three, slender, fine-featured, 
always smiling. His hair was red on one side and white on the other, all matted and filthy from cage and 
travel. "A man could use a bath too," he 
said, when he saw the way Arya was looking at him. "A boy could make a friend." 
"I have friends," Arya said. 
"None I can see," said the one without a nose. He was squat and thick, with huge hands. Black hair 
covered his arms and legs and chest, even his back. He reminded Arya of a drawing she had once seen 
in a book, of an ape from the Summer Isles. The hole in his face made it hard to look at him for long. 
The bald one opened his mouth and hissed like some immense white lizard. When Arya flinched back, 
startled, he opened his mouth wide and waggled his tongue at her, only it was more a stump than a 
tongue. "Stop that," she blurted. 
"A man does not choose his companions in the black cells," the handsome one with the red-and-white 
hair said. Something about the way he talked reminded her of Syrio; it was the same, yet different too. 
"These two, they have no courtesy. A man must ask forgiveness. You are called Arry, is that not so?" 
"Lumpyhead," said the noseless one. "Lumpyhead Lumpyface Stickboy. Have a care, Lorath, he'll hit 
you with his stick." 
"A man must be ashamed of the company he keeps, Arry," the handsome one said. "This man has the 
honor to be Jaqen Hghar, once of the Free City of Lorath. Would that he were home. This man's ill-bred 
companions in captivity are named Rorge"-he waved his tankard at the noseless man-"and Biter." Biter 
hissed at her again, displaying a mouthful of yellowed teeth filed into points. "A man must have some 
name, is that not so? Biter cannot speak and Biter cannot write, yet his teeth are very sharp, so a man 
calls him Biter and he smiles. Are you charmed?" 
Arya backed away from the wagon. "No." They can't hurt me, she told herself, they're all chained up. 
He turned his tankard upside down. "A man must weep." 
Page 51

Rorge, the noseless one, flung his drinking cup at her with a curse. His manacles made him clumsy, yet 
even so he would have sent the heavy pewter tankard crashing into her head if Arya hadn't leapt aside. 
"You get us some beer, pimple. Now!" 
"You shut your mouth!" Arya tried to think what Syrio would have done. She drew her wooden practice 
sword. 
"Come closer," Rorge said, "and I'll shove that stick up your bunghole and fuck you bloody." 
Fear cuts deeper than swords. Arya made herself approach the wagon. Every step was harder than the 
one before. Fierce as a wolverine, calm as still water. The words sang in her head. Syrio would not have 
been afraid. She was almost close enough to touch the wheel when Biter 
lurched to his feet and grabbed for her, his irons clanking and rattling. The manacles brought his hands 
up short, half a foot from her face. He hissed. 
She hit him. Hard, right between his little eyes. 
Screaming, Biter reeled back, and then threw all his weight against his chains. The links slithered and 
turned and grew taut, and Arya heard the creak of old dry wood as the great iron rings strained against 
the floorboards of the wagon. Huge pale hands groped for her while veins bulged along Biter's arms, but 
the bonds held, and finally the man collapsed backward. Blood ran from the weeping sores on his 
cheeks. 
"A boy has more courage than sense," the one who had named himself Jaqen H'ghar observed. 
Arya edged backward away from the wagon. When she felt the hand on her shoulder, she whirled, 
bringing up her stick sword again, but it was only the Bull. "What are you doing?" 
He raised his hands defensively. "Yoren said none of us should go near those three." 
"They don't scare me," Arya said. 
"Then you're stupid. They scare me." The Bull's hand fell to the hilt of his sword, and Rorge began to 
laugh. "Let's get away from them." 
Arya scuffed at the ground with her foot, but she let the Bull lead her around to the front of the inn. 
Rorge's laughter and Biter's hissing followed them. "Want to fight?" she asked the Bull. She wanted to hit 
something. 
He blinked at her, startled. Strands of thick black hair, still wet from the bathhouse, fell across his deep 
blue eyes. "I'd hurt you." 
"You would not." 
"You don't know how strong I am." 
"You don't know how quick I am." 
"You're asking for it, Arry." He drew Praed's longsword. "This is cheap steel, but it's a real sword." 
Page 52

Arya unsheathed Needle. "This is good steel, so it's realer than yours." 
The Bull shook his head. "Promise not to cry if I cut you?" 
"I'll promise if you will." She turned sideways, into her water dancer's stance, but the Bull did not move. 
He was looking at something behind her. "What's wrong?" 
"Gold cloaks." His face closed up tight. 
It couldn't be, Arya thought, but when she glanced back, they were riding up the kingsroad, six in the 
black ringmail and golden cloaks of the City Watch. One was an officer; he wore a black enamel 
breastplate ornamented with four golden disks. They drew up in front of the inn. 
Look with your eyes, Syrio's voice seemed to whisper. Her eyes saw white lather under their saddles; 
the horses had been ridden long and hard. Calm as still water, she took the Bull by the arm and drew him 
back behind a tall flowering hedge. 
"What is it?" he asked. "What are you doing? Let go." 
"Quiet as a shadow," she whispered, pulling him down. 
Some of Yoren's other charges were sitting in front of the bathhouse, waiting their turn at a tub. "You 
men," one of the gold cloaks shouted. "You the ones left to take the black?" 
"We might be," came the cautious answer. 
"We'd rather join you boys," old Reysen said. "We hear it's cold on that Wall." 
The gold cloak officer dismounted. "I have a warrant for a certain boy-" 
Yoren stepped out of the inn, fingering his tangled black beard. "Who is it wants this boy?" 
The other gold cloaks were dismounting to stand beside their horses. "Why are we hiding?" the Bull 
whispered. 
"It's me they want," Arya whispered back. His ear smelled of soap. "You be quiet." 
"The queen wants him, old man, not that it's your concern," the officer said, drawing a ribbon from his 
belt. "Here, Her Grace's seal and warrant." 
Behind the hedge, the Bull shook his head doubtfully. "Why would the queen want you, Arry?" 
She punched his shoulder. "Be quiet!" 
Yoren fingered the warrant ribbon with its blob of golden wax. "Pretty." He spit. "Thing is, the boy's in 
the Night's Watch now. What he done back in the city don't mean piss-all." 
"The queen's not interested in your views, old man, and neither am I," the officer said. "I'll have the boy." 
Arya thought about running, but she knew she wouldn't get far on her donkey when the gold cloaks had 
horses. And she was so tired of running. She'd run when Ser Meryn came for her, and again when they 
Page 53

killed her father. If she was a real water dancer, she would go out there with Needle and kill all of them, 
and never run from anyone ever again. 
"You'll have no one," Yoren said stubbornly. "There's laws on such things." 
The gold cloak drew a shortsword. "Here's your law." 
Yoren looked at the blade. "That's no law, just a sword. Happens I got one too." 
The officer smiled. "Old fool. I have five men with me." 
Yoren spat. "Happens I got thirty." 
The gold cloak laughed. "This lot?" said a big lout with a broken nose. "Who's first?" he shouted, 
showing his steel. 
Tarber plucked a pitchfork out of a bale of hay. "I am." 
"No, I am," called Cutjack, the plump stonemason, pulling his hammer off the leather apron he always 
wore. 
"Me." Kurz came up off the ground with his skinning knife in hand. 
"Me and him." Koss strung his longbow. 
"All of us," said Reysen, snatching up the tall hardwood walking staff he carried. 
Dobber stepped naked out of the bathhouse with his clothes in a bundle, saw what was happening, and 
dropped everything but his dagger. "Is it a fight?" he asked. 
"I guess," said Hot Pie, scrambling on all fours for a big rock to throw. Arya could not believe what she 
was seeing. She hated Hot Pie! Why would he risk himself for her? 
The one with the broken nose still thought it was funny. "You girls put away them rocks and sticks 
before you get spanked. None of you knows what end of a sword to hold." 
"I do!" Arya wouldn't let them die for her like Syrio. She wouldn't! Shoving through the hedge with 
Needle in hand, she slid into a water dancer's stance. 
Broken Nose guffawed. The officer looked her up and down. "Put the blade away, little girl, no one 
wants to hurt you." 
"I'm not a girl!" she yelled, furious. What was wrong with them? They rode all this way for her and here 
she was and they were just smiling at her. "I'm the one you want." 
"He's the one we want." The officer jabbed his shortsword toward the Bull, who'd come forward to 
stand beside her, Praed's cheap steel in his hand. 
But it was a mistake to take his eyes off Yoren, even for an instant. Quick as that, the black brother's 
sword was pressed to the apple of the officer's throat. "Neither's the one you get, less you want me to 
see if your apple's ripe yet. I got me ten, fifteen more brothers in that inn, if you still need convincing. I 
Page 54

was you, I'd let loose of that gutcutter, spread my cheeks over that fat little horse, and gallop on back to 
the city." He spat, and poked harder with the point of his sword. "Now." 
The officer's fingers uncurled. His sword fell in the dust. 
"We'll just keep that," Yoren said. "Good steel's always needed on the Wall." 
"As you say. For now. Men." The gold cloaks sheathed and mounted up. "You'd best scamper up to 
that Wall of yours in a hurry, old man. 
The next time I catch you, I believe I'll have your head to go with the bastard boy's." 
"Better men than you have tried." Yoren slapped the rump of the officer's horse with the flat of his sword 
and sent him reeling off down the kingsroad. His men followed. 
When they were out of sight, Hot Pie began to whoop, but Yoren looked angrier than ever. "Fool! You 
think he's done with us? Next time he won't prance up and hand me no damn ribbon. Get the rest out o' 
them baths, we need to be moving. Ride all night, maybe we can stay ahead o' them for a bit." He 
scooped up the shortsword the officer had dropped. "Who wants this?" 
"Me!" Hot Pie yelled. 
"Don't be using it on Arry." He handed the boy the sword, hilt first, and walked over to Arya, but it was 
the Bull he spoke to. "Queen wants you bad, boy." 
Arya was lost. "Why should she want him?" 
The Bull scowled at her. "Why should she want you? You're nothing but a little gutter rat!" 
"Well, you're nothing but a bastard boy!" Or maybe he was only pretending to be a bastard boy. 
"What's your true name?" 
"Gendry," he said, like he wasn't quite sure. 
"Don't see why no one wants neither o' you," Yoren said, "but they can't have you regardless. You ride 
them two coursers. First sight of a gold cloak, make for the Wall like a dragon's on your tail. The rest o' 
us don't mean spit to them." 
"Except for you," Arya pointed out. "That man said he'd take your head too." 
"Well, as to that," Yoren said, "if he can get it off my shoulders, he's welcome to it." 
CHAPTER 6 
JON 
Page 55

"Sam?" Jon called softly. 
The air smelled of paper and dust and years. Before him, tall wooden shelves rose up into dimness, 
crammed with leatherbound books and bins of ancient scrolls. A faint yellow glow filtered through the 
stacks from some hidden lamp. Jon blew out the taper he carried, preferring not to risk an open flame 
amidst so much old dry paper. Instead he followed the light, wending his way down the narrow aisles 
beneath barrel-vaulted ceilings. All in black, he was a shadow among shadows, dark of hair, long of face, 
grey of eye. Black moleskin gloves covered his hands; the right because it was burned, the left because a 
man felt half a fool wearing only one glove. 
Samwell Tarly sat hunched over a table in a niche carved into the stone of the wall. The glow came from 
the lamp hung over his head. He looked up at the sound of Jon's steps. 
"Have you been here all night?" 
"Have I?" Sam looked startled. 
"You didn't break your fast with us, and your bed hadn't been slept in." Rast suggested that maybe Sam 
had deserted, but Jon never believed it. Desertion required its own sort of courage, and Sam had little 
enough of that. 
"Is it morning? Down here there's no way to know." 
"Sam, you're a sweet fool," Jon said. "You'll miss that bed when we're sleeping on the cold hard ground, 
I promise you." 
Sam yawned. "Maester Aemon sent me to find maps for the Lord Commander. I never thought . . . Jon, 
the books, have you ever seen their like? There are thousands!" 
He gazed about him. "The library at Winterfell has more than a hundred. Did you find the maps?" 
"Oh, yes." Sam's hand swept over the table, fingers plump as sausages indicating the clutter of books 
and scrolls before him. "A dozen, at the least." He unfolded a square of parchment. "The paint has faded, 
but you can see where the mapmaker marked the sites of wildling villages, and there's another book . . . 
where is it now? I was reading it a moment ago." He shoved some scrolls aside to reveal a dusty volume 
bound in rotted leather. "This," he said reverently, "is the account of a journey from the Shadow Tower 
all the way to Lorn Point on the Frozen Shore, written by a ranger named Redwyn. It's not dated, but he 
mentions a Dorren Stark as King in the North, so it must be from before the Conquest. Jon, they fought 
giants! Redwyn even traded with the children of the forest, it's all here." Ever so delicately, he turned 
pages with a finger. "He drew maps as well, see . . ." 
"Maybe you could write an account of our ranging, Sam." 
He'd meant to sound encouraging, but it was the wrong thing to say. The last thing Sam needed was to 
be reminded of what faced them on the morrow. He shuffled the scrolls about aimlessly. "There's more 
maps. If I had time to search . . . everything's a jumble. I could set it all to order, though; I know I could, 
but it would take time . . . well, years, in truth." 
"Mormont wanted those maps a little sooner than that." Jon plucked a scroll from a bin, blew off the 
worst of the dust. A corner flaked off between his fingers as he unrolled it. "Look, this one is crumbling," 
Page 56

he said, frowning over the faded script. 
"Be gentle." Sam came around the table and took the scroll from his hand, holding it as if it were a 
wounded animal. "The important books used to be copied over when they needed them. Some of the 
oldest have been copied half a hundred times, probably." 
"Well, don't bother copying that one. Twenty-three barrels of pickled cod, eighteen jars of fish oil, a 
cask of salt . . ." 
"An inventory," Sam said, "or perhaps a bill of sale." 
"Who cares how much pickled cod they ate six hundred years ago?" Jon wondered. 
"I would." Sam carefully replaced the scroll in the bin from which Jon had plucked it. "You can learn so 
much from ledgers like that, truly you can. it can tell you how many men were in the Night's Watch then, 
how they lived, what they ate . . ." 
"They ate food," said Jon, "and they lived as we live." 
"You'd be surprised. This vault is a treasure, Jon." 
"If you say so." Jon was doubtful. Treasure meant gold, silver, and jewels, not dust, spiders, and rotting 
leather. 
"I do," the fat boy blurted. He was older than Jon, a man grown by law, but it was hard to think of him 
as anything but a boy. "I found drawings of the faces in the trees, and a book about the tongue of the 
children of the forest . . . works that even the Citadel doesn't have, scrolls from old Valyria, counts of the 
seasons written by maesters dead a thousand years . . ." 
"The books will still be here when we return." 
"if we return . . ." 
"The Old Bear is taking two hundred seasoned men, three-quarters of them rangers. Qhorin Halfhand 
will be bringing another hundred brothers from the Shadow Tower. You'll be as safe as if you were back 
in your lord father's castle at Horn Hill." 
Samwell Tarly managed a sad little smile. "I was never very safe in my father's castle either." 
The gods play cruel jests, Jon thought. Pyp and Toad, all a lather to be a part of the great ranging, were 
to remain at Castle Black. it was Samwell Tarly, the self-proclaimed coward, grossly fat, timid, and near 
as bad a rider as he was with a sword, who must face the haunted forest. The Old Bear was taking two 
cages of ravens, so they might send back word as they went. Maester Aemon was blind and far too frail 
to ride with them, so his steward must go in his place. "We need you for the ravens, Sam. And someone 
has to help me keep Grenn humble." 
Sam's chins quivered. "You could care for the ravens, or Grenn could, or anyone," he said with a thin 
edge of desperation in his voice. "I could show you how. You know your letters too, you could write 
down Lord Mormont's messages as well as I" 
"I'm the Old Bear's steward. I'll need to squire for him, tend his horse, set up his tent; I won't have time 
Page 57

to watch over birds as well. Sam, you said the words. You're a brother of the Night's Watch now." 
"A brother of the Night's Watch shouldn't be so scared." 
"We're all scared. We'd be fools if we weren't." Too many rangers had been lost the past two years, 
even Benjen Stark, Jon's uncle. They had found two of his uncle's men in the wood, slain, but the corpses 
had risen in the chill of night. Jon's burnt fingers twitched as he remembered. He still saw the wight in his 
dreams, dead Othor with the burning blue eyes and the cold black hands, but that was the last thing Sam 
needed to be reminded of. "There's no shame in fear, my father told me, what matters is how we face it. 
Come, I'll help you gather up the maps." 
Sam nodded unhappily. The shelves were so closely spaced that they had to walk single file as they left. 
The vault opened onto one of the 
tunnels the brothers called the wormwalks, winding subterranean passages that linked the keeps and 
towers of Castle Black under the earth. In summer the wormwalks were seldom used, save by rats and 
other vermin, but winter was a different matter. When the snows drifted forty and fifty feet high and the 
ice winds came howling out of the north, the tunnels were all that held Castle Black together. 
Soon, Jon thought as they climbed. He'd seen the harbinger that had come to Maester Aemon with 
word of summer's end, the great raven of the Citadel, white and silent as Ghost. He had seen a winter 
once, when he was very young, but everyone agreed that it had been a short one, and mild. This one 
would be different. He could feel it in his bones. 
The steep stone steps had Sam puffing like a blacksmith's bellows by the time they reached the surface. 
They emerged into a brisk wind that made Jon's cloak swirl and snap. Ghost was stretched out asleep 
beneath the wattle-and-daub wall of the granary, but he woke when Jon appeared, bushy white tail held 
stiffly upright as he trotted to them. 
Sam squinted up at the Wall. It loomed above them, an icy cliff seven hundred feet high. Sometimes it 
seemed to Jon almost a living thing, with moods of its own. The color of the ice was wont to change with 
every shift of the light. Now it was the deep blue of frozen rivers, now the dirty white of old snow, and 
when a cloud passed before the sun it darkened to the pale grey of pitted stone. The Wall stretched east 
and west as far as the eye could see, so huge that it shrunk the timbered keeps and stone towers of the 
castle to insignificance. it was the end of the world. 
And we are going beyond it. 
The morning sky was streaked by thin grey clouds, but the pale red line was there behind them. The 
black brothers had dubbed the wanderer Mormont's Torch, saying (only half in jest) that the gods must 
have sent it to light the old man's way through the haunted forest. 
"The comet's so bright you can see it by day now," Sam said, shading his eyes with a fistful of books. 
"Never mind about comets, it's maps the Old Bear wants." 
Ghost loped ahead of them. The grounds seemed deserted this morning, with so many rangers off at the 
brothel in Mole's Town, digging for buried treasure and drinking themselves blind. Grenn had gone with 
them. Pyp and Halder and Toad had offered to buy him his first woman to celebrate his first ranging. 
They'd wanted Jon and Sam to come as well, but Sam was almost as frightened of whores as he was of 
the haunted forest, and Jon had wanted no part of it. "Do what you want," he told Toad, "I took a vow." 
Page 58

As they passed the sept, he heard voices raised in song. Some men want whores on the eve of battle, 
and some want gods. Jon wondered 
who felt better afterward. The sept tempted him no more than the brothel; his own gods kept their 
temples in the wild places, where the weirwoods spread their bone-white branches. The Seven have no 
power beyond the Wall, he thought, but my gods will be waiting. 
Outside the armory, Ser Endrew Tarth was working with some raw recruits. They'd come in last night 
with Conwy, one of the wandering crows who roamed the Seven Kingdoms collecting men for the Wall. 
This new crop consisted of a greybeard leaning on a staff, two blond boys with the look of brothers, a 
foppish youth in soiled satin, a raggy man with a clubfoot, and some grinning loon who must have fancied 
himself a warrior. Ser Endrew was showing him the error of that presumption. He was a gentler 
master-at-arms than Ser Alliser Thorne had been, but his lessons would still raise bruises. Sam winced at 
every blow, but Jon Snow watched the swordplay closely. 
"What do you make of them, Snow?" Donal Noye stood in the door of his armory, bare-chested under 
a leather apron, the stump of his left arm uncovered for once. With his big gut and barrel chest, his flat 
nose and bristly black jaw, Noyc did not make a pretty sight, but he was a welcome one nonetheless. 
The armorer had proved himself a good friend. 
"They smell of summer," Jon said as Ser Endrew bullrushed his foe and knocked him sprawling. "Where 
did Conwy find them?" 
"A lord's dungeon near Gulltown," the smith replied. "A brigand, a barber, a beggar, two orphans, and a 
boy whore. With such do we defend the realms of men." 
"They'll do." Jon gave Sam a private smile. "We did." 
Noye drew him closer. "You've heard these tidings of your brother?" 
"Last night." Conwy and his charges had brought the news north with them, and the talk in the common 
room had been of little else. Jon was still not certain how he felt about it. Robb a king? The brother he'd 
played with, fought with, shared his first cup of wine with? But not mother's milk, no. So now Robb will 
sip summerwine from jeweled goblets, while I'm kneeling beside some stream sucking snowmelt from 
cupped hands. "Robb will make a good king," he said loyally. 
"Will he now?" The smith eyed him frankly. "I hope that's so, boy, but once I might have said the same 
of Robert." 
"They say you forged his warhammer," Jon remembered. 
"Aye. I was his man, a Baratheon man, smith and armorer at Storm's End until I lost the arm. I'm old 
enough to remember Lord Steffon before the sea took him, and I knew those three sons of his since they 
got their names. I tell you this-Robert was never the same after he put on that crown. Some men are like 
swords, made for fighting. Hang them up and they go to rust." 
"And his brothers?" Jon asked. 
The armorer considered that a moment. "Robert was the true steel. Stannis is pure iron, black and hard 
and strong, yes, but brittle, the way iron gets. He'll break before he bends. And Renly, that one, he's 
Page 59

copper, bright and shiny, pretty to look at but not worth all that much at the end of the day." 
And what metal is Robb? Jon did not ask. Noye was a Baratheon man; likely he thought Joffrey the 
lawful king and Robb a traitor. Among the brotherhood of the Night's Watch, there was an unspoken 
pact never to probe too deeply into such matters. Men came to the Wall from all of the Seven 
Kingdoms, and old loves and loyalties were not easily forgotten, no matter how many oaths a man swore 
. . . as Jon himself had good reason to know. Even Sam-his father's House was sworn to Highgarden, 
whose Lord Tyrell supported King Renly. Best not to talk of such things. The Night's Watch took no 
sides. "Lord Mormont awaits us," Jon said. 
"I won't keep you from the Old Bear." Noye clapped him on the shoulder and smiled. "May the gods go 
with you on the morrow, Snow. You bring back that uncle of yours, you hear?" 
"We will," Jon promised him. 
Lord Commander Mormont had taken up residence in the King's Tower after the fire had gutted his 
own. Jon left Ghost with the guards outside the door. "More stairs," said Sam miserably as they started 
up. "I hate stairs." 
"Well, that's one thing we won't face in the wood." 
When they entered the solar, the raven spied them at once. "Snow!" the bird shrieked. Mormont broke 
off his conversation. "Took you long enough with those maps." He pushed the remains of breakfast out of 
the way to make room on the table. "Put them here. I'll have a look at them later." 
Thoren Smallwood, a sinewy ranger with a weak chin and a weaker mouth hidden under a thin scraggle 
of beard, gave Jon and Sam a cool look. He had been one of Alliser Thorne's henchmen, and had no 
love for either of them. "The Lord Commander's place is at Castle Black, lording and commanding," he 
told Mormont, ignoring the newcomers, "it seems to me." 
The raven flapped big black wings. "Me, me, me." 
"If you are ever Lord Commander, you may do as you please," Mormont told the ranger, "but it seems 
to me that I have not died yet, nor have the brothers put you in my place." 
"I'm First Ranger now, with Ben Stark lost and Ser Jaremy killed," Smallwood said stubbornly. "The 
command should be mine." 
Mormont would have none of it. "I sent out Ben Stark, and Ser Wayrnar before him. I do not mean to 
send you after them and sit wondering how long I must wait before I give you up for lost as well." He 
pointed. "And Stark remains First Ranger until we know for a certainty that he is dead. Should that day 
come, it will be me who names his successor, not you. Now stop wasting my time. We ride at first light, 
or have you forgotten?" 
Smallwood pushed to his feet. "As my lord commands." On the way out, he frowned at Jon, as if it were 
somehow his fault. 
"First Ranger!" The Old Bear's eyes lighted on Sam. "I'd sooner name you First Ranger. He has the 
effrontery to tell me to my face that I'm too old to ride with him. Do I look old to you, boy?" The hair that 
had retreated from Mormont's spotted scalp had regrouped beneath his chin in a shaggy grey beard that 
Page 60

covered much of his chest. He thumped it hard. "Do I look frail?" 
Sam opened his mouth, gave a little squeak. The Old Bear terrified him. "No, my lord," Jon offered 
quickly. "You look strong as a . . . a . . . 
"Don't cozen me, Snow, you know I won't have it. Let me have a look at these maps." Mormont pawed 
through them brusquely, giving each no more than a glance and a grunt. "Was this all you could find?" 
"I . . . m-m-my lord," Sam stammered, "there . . . there were more, b-b-but . . . the dis-disorder . . ." 
"These are old," Mormont complained, and his raven echoed him with a sharp cry of "Old, old." 
"The villages may come and go, but the hills and rivers will be in the same places," Jon pointed out. 
"True enough. Have you chosen your ravens yet, Tarly?" 
"M-m-maester Aemon m-means to p-pick them come evenfall, after the f-f-feeding." 
"I'll have his best. Smart birds, and strong." 
"Strong," his own bird said, preening. "Strong, strong." 
"If it happens that we're all butchered out there, I mean for my successor to know where and how we 
died." 
Talk of butchery reduced Samwell Tarly to speechlessness. Mormont leaned forward. "Tarly, when I 
was a lad half your age, my lady mother told me that if I stood about with my mouth open, a weasel was 
like to mistake it for his lair and run down my throat. If you have something to say, say it. Otherwise, 
beware of weasels." He waved a brusque dismissal. "Off with you, I'm too busy for folly. No doubt the 
maester has some work you can do." 
Sam swallowed, stepped back, and scurried out so quickly he almost tripped over the rushes. 
"Is that boy as big a fool as he seems?" the Lord Commander asked when he'd gone. "Fool," the raven 
complained. Mormont did not wait for Jon to answer. "His lord father stands high in King Renly's 
councils, 
and I had half a notion to dispatch him . . . no, best not. Renly is not like to heed a quaking fat boy. I'll 
send Ser Arnell. He's a deal steadier, and his mother was one of the green-apple Fossoways." 
"If it please my lord, what would you have of King Renly?" 
"The same things I'd have of all of them, lad. Men, horses, swords, armor, grain, cheese, wine, wool, 
nails . . . the Night's Watch is not proud, we take what is offered." His fingers drummed against the 
roughhewn planks of the table. "If the winds have been kind, Ser Alliser should reach King's Landing by 
the turn of the moon, but whether this boy Joffrey will pay him any heed, I do not know. House Lannister 
has never been a friend to the Watch." 
"Thorne has the wight's hand to show them." A grisly pale thing with black fingers, it was, that twitched 
and stirred in its jar as if it were still alive. 
Page 61

"Would that we had another hand to send to Renly." 
"Dywen says you can find anything beyond the Wall." 
"Aye, Dywen says. And the last time he went ranging, he says he saw a bear fifteen feet tall." Mormont 
snorted. "My sister is said to have taken a bear for her lover. I'd believe that before I'd believe one fifteen 
feet tall. Though in a world where dead come walking . . . ah, even so, a man must believe his eyes. I 
have seen the dead walk. I've not seen any giant bears." He gave Jon a long, searching look. "But we 
were speaking of hands. How is yours?" 
"Better." Jon peeled off his moleskin glove and showed him. Scars covered his arm halfway to the 
elbow, and the mottled pink flesh still felt tight and tender, but it was healing. "It itches, though. Maester 
Aemon says that's good. He gave me a salve to take with me when we ride." 
"You can wield Longclaw despite the pain?" 
"Well enough." Jon flexed his fingers, opening and closing his fist the way the maester had shown him. 
"I'm to work the fingers every day to keep them nimble, as Maester Aemon said." 
"Blind he may be, but Aemon knows what he's about. I pray the gods let us keep him another twenty 
years. Do you know that he might have been king?" 
Jon was taken by surprise. "He told me his father was king, but not . . . I thought him perhaps a younger 
son." 
"So he was. His father's father was Daeron Targaryen, the Second of His Name, who brought Dorne 
into the realm. Part of the pact was that he wed a Dornish princess. She gave him four sons. Aemon's 
father Maekar was the youngest of those, and Aemon was his third son. Mind you, all this happened long 
before I was born, ancient as Smallwood would make me." 
"Maester Aemon was named for the Dragonknight." 
"So he was. Some say Prince Aemon was King Daeron's true father, not Aegon the Unworthy. Be that 
as it may, our Aemon lacked the Dragonknight's martial nature. He likes to say he had a slow sword but 
quick wits. Small wonder his grandfather packed him off to the Citadel. He was nine or ten, I believe . . . 
and ninth or tenth in the line of succession as well." 
Maester Aemon had counted more than a hundred name days, Jon knew. Frail, shrunken, wizened, and 
blind, it was hard to imagine him as a little boy no older than Arya. 
Mormont continued. "Aemon was at his books when the eldest of his uncles, the heir apparent, was slain 
in a tourney mishap. He left two sons, but they followed him to the grave not long after, during the Great 
Spring Sickness. King Daeron was also taken, so the crown passed to Daeron's second son, Aerys." 
"The Mad King?" Jon was confused. Aerys had been king before Robert, that wasn't so long ago. 
"No, this was Aerys the First. The one Robert deposed was the second of that name." 
"How long ago was this?" 
"Eighty years or close enough," the Old Bear said, "and no, I still hadn't been born, though Aemon had 
Page 62

forged half a dozen links of his maester's chain by then. Aerys wed his own sister, as the Targaryens 
were wont to do, and reigned for ten or twelve years. Aemon took his vows and left the Citadel to serve 
at some lordling's court . . . until his royal uncle died without issue. The Iron Throne passed to the last of 
King Daeron's four sons. That was Maekar, Aemon's father. The new king summoned all his sons to 
court and would have made Aemon part of his councils, but he refused, saying that would usurp the place 
rightly belonging to the Grand Maester. Instead he served at the keep of his eldest brother, another 
Daeron. Well, that one died too, leaving only a feeble-witted daughter as heir. Some pox he caught from 
a whore, I believe. The next brother was Aerion." 
"Aerion the Monstrous?" Jon knew that name. "The Prince Who Thought He Was a Dragon" was one of 
Old Nan's more gruesome tales. His little brother Bran had loved it. 
"The very one, though he named himself Aerion Brightflame. One night, in his cups, he drank a jar of 
wildfire, after telling his friends it would transform him into a dragon, but the gods were kind and it 
transformed him into a corpse. Not quite a year after, King Maekar died in battle against an outlaw lord." 
Jon was not entirely innocent of the history of the realm; his own 
maester had seen to that. "That was the year of the Great Council," he said. "The lords passed over 
Prince Aerion's infant son and Prince Daeron's daughter and gave the crown to Aegon." 
"Yes and no. First they offered it, quietly, to Aemon. And quietly he refused. The gods meant for him to 
serve, not to rule, he told them. He had sworn a vow and would not break it, though the High Septon 
himself offered to absolve him. Well, no sane man wanted any blood of Aerion's on the throne, and 
Daeron's girl was a lackwit besides being female, so they had no choice but to turn to Aemon's younger 
brother-Aegon, the Fifth of His Name. Aegon the Unlikely, they called him, born the fourth son of a 
fourth son. Aemon knew, and rightly, that if he remained at court those who disliked his brother's rule 
would seek to use him, so he came to the Wall. And here he has remained, while his brother and his 
brother's son and his son each reigned and died in turn, until Jaime Lannister put an end to the line of the 
Dragonkings." 
"King, " croaked the raven. The bird flapped across the solar to land on Mormont's shoulder. "King," it 
said again, strutting back and forth. 
"He likes that word," Jon said, smiling. 
"An easy word to say. An easy word to like." 
"King," the bird said again. 
"I think he means for you to have a crown, my lord." 
"The realm has three kings already, and that's two too many for my liking." Mormont stroked the raven 
under the beak with a finger, but all the while his eyes never left Jon Snow. 
It made him feel odd. "My lord, why have you told me this, about Maester Aemon?" 
"Must I have a reason?" Mormont shifted in his seat, frowning. "Your brother Robb has been crowned 
King in the North. You and Aemon have that in common. A king for a brother." 
"And this too," said Jon. "A vow." 
Page 63

The Old Bear gave a loud snort, and the raven took flight, flapping in a circle about the room, "Give me 
a man for every vow I've seen broken and the Wall will never lack for defenders." 
"I've always known that Robb would be Lord of Winterfell." 
Mormont gave a whistle, and the bird flew to him again and settled on his arm. "A lord's one thing, a 
king's another." He offered the raven a handful of corn from his pocket. "They will garb your brother 
Robb in silks, satins, and velvets of a hundred different colors, while you live and die in black ringmail. 
He will wed some beautiful princess and father sons on her. You'll have no wife, nor will you ever hold a 
child of your own blood in your arms. Robb will rule, you will serve. Men will call you a crow. Him they'll 
call Your Grace. Singers will praise every little thing 
he does, while your greatest deeds all go unsung. Tell me that none of this troubles you, Jon . . . and I'll 
name you a liar, and know I have the truth of it." 
Jon drew himself up, taut as a bowstring. "And if it did trouble me, what might I do, bastard as I am?" 
"What will you do?" Mormont asked. "Bastard as you are?" 
"Be troubled," said Jon, "and keep my vows." 
CHAPTER 7 
CATELYN 
Her son's crown was fresh from the forge, and it seemed to Catelyn Stark that the weight of it pressed 
heavy on Robb's head. 
The ancient crown of the Kings of Winter had been lost three centuries ago, yielded up to Aegon the 
Conqueror when Torrhen Stark knelt in submission. What Aegon had done with it no man could say. 
Lord Hoster's smith had done his work well, and Robb's crown looked much as the other was said to 
have looked in the tales told of the Stark kings of old; an open circlet of hammered bronze incised with 
the runes of the First Men, surmounted by nine black iron spikes wrought in the shape of longswords. Of 
gold and silver and gemstones, it had none; bronze and iron were the metals of winter, dark and strong to 
fight against the cold. 
As they waited in Riverrun's Great Hall for the prisoner to be brought before them, she saw Robb push 
back the crown so it rested upon the thick auburn mop of his hair; moments later, he moved it forward 
again; later he gave it a quarter turn, as if that might make it sit more easily on his brow. It is no easy thing 
to wear a crown, Catelyn thought, watching, especially for a boy of fifteen years. 
When the guards brought in the captive, Robb called for his sword. Olyvar Frey offered it up hilt first, 
and her son drew the blade and laid it bare across his knees, a threat plain for all to see. "Your Grace, 
here is the man you asked for," announced Ser Robin Ryger, captain of the Tully household guard. 
"Kneel before the king, Lannister!" Theon Greyjoy shouted. Ser Robin forced the prisoner to his knees. 
Page 64

He did not look a lion, Catelyn reflected. This Ser Cleos Frey was a son of the Lady Genna who was 
sister to Lord Tywin Lannister, but he had none of the fabled Lannister beauty, the fair hair and green 
eyes. Instead he had inherited the stringy brown locks, weak chin, and thin face of his sire, Ser Emmon 
Frey, old Lord Walder's second son. His eyes were pale and watery and he could not seem to stop 
blinking, but perhaps that was only the light. The cells below Riverrun were dark and damp . . . and these 
days crowded as well. 
"Rise, Ser Cleos." Her son's voice was not as icy as his father's would have been, but he did not sound a 
boy of fifteen either. War had made a man of him before his time. Morning light glimmered faintly against 
the edge of the steel across his knees. 
Yet it was not the sword that made Ser Cleos Frey anxious; it was the beast. Grey Wind, her son had 
named him. A direwolf large as any elkhound, lean and smoke-dark, with eyes like molten gold. When 
the beast padded forward and sniffed at the captive knight, every man in that hall could smell the scent of 
fear. Ser Cleos had been taken during the battle in the Whispering Wood, where Grey Wind had ripped 
out the throats of half a dozen men. 
The knight scrambled up, edging away with such alacrity that some of the watchers laughed aloud. 
"Thank you, my lord." 
"Your Grace," barked Lord Umber, the Greatjon, ever the loudest of Robb's northern bannermen . . . 
and the truest and fiercest as well, or so he insisted. He had been the first to proclaim her son King in the 
North, and he would brook no slight to the honor of his new-made sovereign. 
"Your Grace," Ser Cleos corrected hastily. "Pardons." 
He is not a bold man, this one, Catelyn thought. More of a Frey than a Lannister, in truth. His cousin the 
Kingslayer would have been a much different matter. They would never have gotten that honorific 
through Ser Jaime Lannister's perfect teeth. 
"I brought you from your cell to carry my message to your cousin Cersei Lannister in King's Landing. 
You'll travel under a peace banner, with thirty of my best men to escort you." 
Ser Cleos was visibly relieved. "Then I should be most glad to bring His Grace's message to the queen." 
"Understand," Robb said, "I am not giving you your freedom. Your grandfather Lord Walder pledged 
me his support and that of House Frey. Many of your cousins and uncles rode with us in the Whispering 
Wood, but you chose to fight beneath the lion banner. That makes you a Lannister, 
not a Frey. I want your pledge, on your honor as a knight, that after you deliver my message you'll 
return with the queen's reply, and resume your captivity." 
Ser Cleos answered at once. "I do so vow." 
"Every man in this hall has heard you," warned Catelyn's brother Ser Edmure Tully, who spoke for 
Riverrun and the lords of the Trident in the place of their dying father. "If you do not return, the whole 
realm will know you forsworn." 
"I will do as I pledged," Ser Cleos replied stiffly. "What is this message? " 
Page 65

"An offer of peace." Robb stood, longsword in hand. Grey Wind moved to his side. The hall grew 
hushed. "Tell the Queen Regent that if she meets my terms, I will sheath this sword, and make an end to 
the war between us." 
In the back of the hall, Catelyn glimpsed the tall, gaunt figure of Lord Rickard Karstark shove through a 
rank of guards and out the door. No one else moved. Robb paid the disruption no mind. "Olyvar, the 
paper," he commanded. The squire took his longsword and handed up a rolled parchment. 
Robb unrolled it. "First, the queen must release my sisters and provide them with transport by sea from 
King's Landing to White Harbor. It is to be understood that Sansa's betrothal to Joffrey Baratheon is at 
an end. When I receive word from my castellan that my sisters have returned unharmed to Winterfell, I 
will release the queen's cousins, the squire Willem Lannister and your brother Tion Frey, and give them 
safe escort to Casterly Rock or wheresoever she desires them delivered." 
Catelyn Stark wished she could read the thoughts that hid behind each face, each furrowed brow and 
pair of tightened lips. 
"Secondly, my lord father's bones will be returned to us, so he may rest beside his brother and sister in 
the crypts beneath Winterfell, as he would have wished. The remains of the men of his household guard 
who died in his service at King's Landing must also be returned." 
Living men had gone south, and cold bones would return. Ned had the truth of it, she thought. His place 
was at Winterfell, he said as much, but would I hear him? No. Go, I told him, you must be Robert's 
Hand, for the good of our House, for the sake of our children . . . my doing, mine, no other . . . 
"Third, my father's greatsword Ice will be delivered to my hand, here at Riverrun." 
She watched her brother Ser Edmure Tully as he stood with his thumbs hooked over his swordbelt, his 
face as still as stone. 
"Fourth, the queen will command her father Lord Tywin to release 
those knights and lords bannermen of mine that he took captive in the battle on the Green Fork of the 
Trident. Once he does so, I shall release my own captives taken in the Whispering Wood and the Battle 
of the Camps, save Jaime Lannister alone, who will remain my hostage for his father's good behavior." 
She studied Theon Greyjoy's sly smile, wondering what it meant. That young man had a way of looking 
as though he knew some secret jest that only he was privy to; Catelyn had never liked it. 
"Lastly, King Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claims to dominion over the north. 
Henceforth we are no part of their realm, but a free and independent kingdom, as of old. Our domain 
shall include all the Stark lands north of the Neck, and in addition the lands watered by the River Trident 
and its vassal streams, bounded by the Golden Tooth to the west and the Mountains of the Moon in the 
east." 
"THE KING IN THE NORTH!" boomed Greatjon Umber, a ham-sized fist hammering at the air as he 
shouted. "Stark! Stark! The King in the North! 
Robb rolled up the parchment again. "Maester Vyman has drawn a map, showing the borders we claim. 
You shall have a copy for the queen. Lord Tywin must withdraw beyond these borders, and cease his 
raiding, burning, and pillage. The Queen Regent and her son shall make no claims to taxes, incomes, nor 
Page 66

service from my people, and shall free my lords and knights from all oaths of fealty, vows, pledges, 
debts, and obligations owed to the Iron Throne and the Houses Baratheon and Lanister. Additionally, the 
Lannisters shall deliver ten highborn hostages, to be mutually agreed upon, as a pledge of peace. These I 
will treat as honored guests, according to their station. So long as the terms of this pact are abided with 
faithfully, I shall release two hostages every year, and return them safely to their families." Robb tossed 
the rolled parchment at the knight's feet. "There are the terms. If she meets them, I'll give her peace. if 
not" - he whistled, and Grey Wind moved forward snarling - "I'll give her another Whispering Wood." 
"Stark!" the Greatjon roared again, and now other voices took up the cry. "Stark, Stark, King in the 
North!" The direwolf threw back his head and howled. 
Ser Cleos had gone the color of curdled milk. "The queen shall hear your message, my-Your Grace." 
"Good," Robb said. "Ser Robin, see that he has a good meal and clean clothing. He's to ride at first 
light." 
"As you command, Your Grace," Ser Robin Ryger replied. 
"Then we are done." The assembled knights and lords bannermen bent their knees as Robb turned to 
leave, Grey Wind at his heels. Olyvar 
Frey scrambled ahead to open the door. Catelyn followed them out, her brother at her side. 
"You did well," she told her son in the gallery that led from the rear of the hall, "though that business with 
the wolf was japery more befitting a boy than a king." 
Robb scratched Grey Wind behind the ear. "Did you see the look on his face, Mother?" he asked, 
smiling. 
"What I saw was Lord Karstark, walking out." 
"As did I" Robb lifted off his crown with both hands and gave it to Olyvar. "Take this thing back to my 
bedchamber." 
"At once, Your Grace." The squire hurried off. 
"I'll wager there were others who felt the same as Lord Karstark," her brother Edmure declared. "How 
can we talk of peace while the Lannisters spread like a pestilence over my father's domains, stealing his 
crops and slaughtering his people? I say again, we ought to be marching on Harrenhal." 
"We lack the strength," Robb said, though unhappily. 
Edmure persisted. "Do we grow stronger sitting here? Our host dwindles every day." 
"And whose doing is that?" Catelyn snapped at her brother. It had been at Edmure's insistence that 
Robb had given the river lords leave to depart after his crowning, each to defend his own lands. Ser 
Marq Piper and Lord Karyl Vance had been the first to go. Lord Jonos Bracken had followed, vowing 
to reclaim the burnt shell of his castle and bury his dead, and now Lord Jason Mallister had announced 
his intent to return to his seat at Seagard, still mercifully untouched by the fighting. 
"You cannot ask my river lords to remain idle while their fields are being pillaged and their people put to 
Page 67

the sword," Ser Edmure said, "but Lord Karstark is a northman. It would be an ill thing if he were to 
leave us." 
"I'll speak with him," said Robb. "He lost two sons in the Whispering Wood. Who can blame him if he 
does not want to make peace with their killers . . . with my father's killers . . ." 
"More bloodshed will not bring your father back to us, or Lord Rickard's sons," Catelyn said. "An offer 
had to be madethough a wiser man might have offered sweeter terms." 
"Any sweeter and I would have gagged." Her son's beard had grown in redder than his auburn hair. 
Robb seemed to think it made him look fierce, royal . . . older. But bearded or no, he was still a youth of 
fifteen, and wanted vengeance no less than Rickard Karstark. it had been no easy thing to convince him 
to make even this offer, poor as it was. 
"Cersei Lannister will never consent to trade your sisters for a pair of 
cousins. It's her brother she'll want, as you know full well." She had told him as much before, but 
Catelyn was finding that kings do not listen half so attentively as sons. 
"I can't release the Kingslayer, not even if I wanted to. My lords would never abide it." 
"Your lords made you their king." 
"And can unmake me just as easy." 
"If your crown is the price we must pay to have Arya and Sansa returned safe, we should pay it willingly. 
Half your lords would like to murder Lannister in his cell. If he should die while he's your prisoner, men 
will say-" 
"-that he well deserved it," Robb finished. 
"And your sisters?" Catelyn asked sharply. "Will they deserve their deaths as well? I promise you, if any 
harm comes to her brother, Cersei will pay us back blood for blood-" 
"Lannister won't die," Robb said. "No one so much as speaks to him without my warrant. He has food, 
water, clean straw, more comfort than he has any right to. But I won't free him, not even for Arya and 
Sansa." 
Her son was looking down at her, Catelyn realized. Was it war that made him grow so fast, she 
wondered, or the crown they had put on his head? "Are you afraid to have Jaime Lannister in the field 
again, is that the truth of it?" 
Grey Wind growled, as if he sensed Robb's anger, and Edmure Tully put a brotherly hand on Catelyn's 
shoulder. "Cat, don't. The boy has the right of this." 
"Don't call me the boy," Robb said, rounding on his uncle, his anger spilling out all at once on poor 
Edmure, who had only meant to support him. "I'm almost a man grown, and a king-your king, ser. And I 
don't fear Jaime Lannister. I defeated him once, I'll defeat him again if I must, only . ." He pushed a fall of 
hair out of his eyes and gave a shake of the head. "I might have been able to trade the Kingslayer for 
Father, but . . " 
Page 68

. but not for the girls?" Her voice was icy quiet. "Girls are not important enough, are they?" 
Robb made no answer, but there was hurt in his eyes. Blue eyes, Tully eyes, eyes she had given him. 
She had wounded him, but he was too much his father's son to admit it. 
That was unworthy of me, she told herself. Gods be good, what is to become of me? He is doing his 
best, trying so hard, I know it, I see it, and yet . . . I have lost my Ned, the rock my life was built on, I 
could not bear to lose the girls as well . . . 
"I'll do all I can for my sisters," Robb said. "If the queen has any sense, she'll accept my terms. If not, I'll 
make her rue the day she refused me." 
Plainly, he'd had enough of the subject. "Mother, are you certain you will not consent to go to the 
Twins? You would be farther from the fighting, and you could acquaint yourself with Lord Frey's 
daughters to help me choose my bride when the war is done." 
He wants me gone, Catelyn thought wearily. Kings are not supposed to have mothers, it would seem, 
and I tell him things he does not want to hear. "You're old enough to decide which of Lord Walder's girls 
you prefer without your mother's help, Robb." 
"Then go with Theon. He leaves on the morrow. He'll help the Mallisters escort that lot of captives to 
Seagard and then take ship for the Iron Islands. You could find a ship as well, and be back at Winterfell 
with a moon's turn, if the winds are kind. Bran and Rickon need you." 
And you do not, is that what you mean to say? "My lord father has little enough time remaining him. So 
long as your grandfather lives, my place is at Riverrun with him." 
"I could command you to go. As king. I could." 
Catelyn ignored that. "I'll say again, I would sooner you sent someone else to Pyke, and kept Theon 
close to you." 
"Who better to treat with Balon Greyjoy than his son?" 
"Jason Mallister," offered Catelyn. "Tytos Blackwood. Stevron Frey. Anyone . . . but not Theon." 
Her son squatted beside Grey Wind, ruffling the wolf's fur and incidentally avoiding her eyes. "Theon's 
fought bravely for us. I told you how he saved Bran from those wildlings in the wolfswood. If the 
Lannisters won't make peace, I'll have need of Lord Greyjoy's longships." 
"You'll have them sooner if you keep his son as hostage." 
"He's been a hostage half his life." 
"For good reason," Catelyn said. "Balon Greyjoy is not a man to be trusted. He wore a crown himself, 
remember, if only for a season. He may aspire to wear one again." 
Robb stood. "I will not grudge him that. If I'm King in the North, let him be King of the Iron Islands, if 
that's his desire. I'll give him a crown gladly, so long as he helps us bring down the Lannisters." 
"Robb-" 
Page 69

"I'm sending Theon. Good day, Mother. Grey Wind, come." Robb walked off briskly, the direwolf 
padding beside him. 
Catelyn could only watch him go. Her son and now her king. How queer that felt. Command, she had 
told him back in Moat Cailin. And so he did. "I am going to visit Father," she announced abruptly. "Come 
with me, Edmure." 
"I need to have a word with those new bowmen Ser Desmond is training. I'll visit him later." 
If he still lives, Catelyn thought, but she said nothing. Her brother would sooner face battle than that 
sickroom. 
The shortest way to the central keep where her father lay dying was through the godswood, with its 
grass and wildflowers and thick stands of elm and redwood. A wealth of rustling leaves still clung to the 
branches of the trees, all ignorant of the word the white raven had brought to Riverrun a fortnight past. 
Autumn had come, the Conclave had declared, but the gods had not seen fit to tell the winds and woods 
as yet. For that Catelyn was duly grateful. Autumn was always a fearful time, with the specter of winter 
looming ahead. Even the wisest man never knew whether his next harvest would be the last. 
Hoster Tully, Lord of Riverrun, lay abed in his solar, with its commanding view to the east where the 
rivers Tumblestone and Red Fork met beyond the walls of his castle. He was sleeping when Catelyn 
entered, his hair and beard as white as his featherbed, his once portly frame turned small and frail by the 
death that grew within him. 
Beside the bed, still dressed in mail hauberk and travel-stained cloak, sat her father's brother, the 
Blackfish. His boots were dusty and spattered with dried mud. "Does Robb know you are returned, 
Uncle?" Ser Brynden Tully was Robb's eyes and ears, the commander of his scouts and outriders. 
"No. I came here straight from the stables, when they told me the king was holding court. His Grace will 
want to hear my tidings in private first I'd think." The Blackfish was a tall, lean man, grey of hair and 
precise in his movements, his clean-shaven face lined and windburnt. "How is he?" he asked, and she 
knew he did not mean Robb. 
"Much the same. The maester gives him drearnwine and milk of the poppy for his pain, so he sleeps 
most of the time, and eats too little. He seems weaker with each day that passes." 
"Does he speak?" 
"Yes . . . but there is less and less sense to the things he says. He talks of his regrets, of unfinished tasks, 
of people long dead and times long past. Sometimes he does not know what season it is, or who I am. 
Once he called me by Mother's name." 
"He misses her still," Ser Brynden answered. "You have her face. I can see it in your cheekbones, and 
your jaw . . ." 
"You remember more of her than I do. It has been a long time." She seated herself on the bed and 
brushed away a strand of fine white hair that had fallen across her father's face. 
"Each time I ride out, I wonder if I shall find him alive or dead on my return." Despite their quarrels, 
there was a deep bond between her father and the brother he had once disowned. 
Page 70

"At least you made your peace with him." 
They sat for a time in silence, until Catelyn raised her head. "You spoke of tidings that Robb needed to 
hear?" Lord Hoster moaned and rolled onto his side, almost as if he had heard. 
Brynden stood. "Come outside. Best if we do not wake him." 
She followed him out onto the stone balcony that jutted three-sided from the solar like the prow of a 
ship. Her uncle glanced up, frowning. "You can see it by day now. My men call it the Red Messenger . . . 
but what is the message?" 
Catelyn raised her eyes, to where the faint red line of the comet traced a path across the deep blue sky 
like a long scratch across the face of god. "The Greatjon told Robb that the old gods have unfurled a red 
flag of vengeance for Ned. Edmure thinks it's an omen of victory for Riverrunhe sees a fish with a long 
tail, in the Tully colors, red against blue." She sighed. "I wish I had their faith. Crimson is a Lannister 
color." 
"That thing's not crimson," Ser Brynden said. "Nor Tully red, the mud red of the river. That's blood up 
there, child, smeared across the sky.'' 
"Our blood or theirs?" 
"Was there ever a war where only one side bled?" Her uncle gave a shake of the head. "The riverlands 
are awash in blood and flame all around the Gods Eye. The fighting has spread south to the Blackwater 
and north across the Trident, almost to the Twins. Marq Piper and Karyl Vance have won some small 
victories, and this southron lordling Beric Dondarrion has been raiding the raiders, falling upon Lord 
Tywin's foraging parties and vanishing back into the woods. It's said that Ser Burton Crakehall was 
boasting that he'd slain Dondarrion, until he led his column into one of Lord Beric's traps and got every 
man of them killed." 
"Some of Ned's guard from King's Landing are with this Lord Beric," Catelyn recalled. "May the gods 
preserve them." 
"Dondarrion and this red priest who rides with him are clever enough to preserve themselves, if the tales 
be true," her uncle said, "but your father's bannermen make a sadder tale. Robb should never have let 
them go. They've scattered like quail, each man trying to protect his own, and it's folly, Cat, folly. Jonos 
Bracken was wounded in the fighting amidst the ruins of his castle, and his nephew Hendry slain. Tytos 
Blackwood's swept the Lannisters off his lands, but they took every cow and pig and speck of grain and 
left him nothing to defend but Raventree Hall and a scorched desert. Darry men recaptured their lord's 
keep but held it less than a fortnight before Gregor Clegane descended on them and put the whole 
garrison to the sword, even their lord." 
Catelyn was horrorstruck. "Darry was only a child." 
"Aye, and the last of his line as well. The boy would have brought a fine ransom, but what does gold 
mean to a frothing dog like Gregor Clegane? That beast's head would make a noble gift for all the people 
of the realm, I vow." 
Catelyn knew Ser Gregor's evil reputation, yet still "Don't speak to me of heads, Uncle. Cersei has 
mounted Ned's on a spike above the walls of the Red Keep, and left it for the crows and flies." Even 
Page 71

now, it was hard for her to believe that he was truly gone. Some nights she would wake in darkness, 
half-asleep, and for an instant expect to find him there beside her. "Clegane is no more than Lord Tywin's 
catspaw." For Tywin Lannister-Lord of Casterly Rock, Warden of the West, father to Queen Cersei, 
Ser Jaime the Kingslayer, and Tyrion the Imp, and grandfather to Joffrey Baratheon, the new-crowned 
boy king-was the true danger, Catelyn believed. 
"True enough," Ser Brynden admitted. "And Tywin Lannister is no man's fool. He sits safe behind the 
walls of Harrenhal, feeding his host on our harvest and burning what he does not take. Gregor is not the 
only dog he's loosed. Ser Amory Lorch is in the field as well, and some sellsword out of Qohor who'd 
sooner maim a man than kill him. I've seen what they leave behind them. Whole villages put to the torch, 
women raped and mutilated, butchered children left unburied to draw wolves and wild dogs . . . it would 
sicken even the dead." 
"When Edmure hears this, he will rage." 
"And that will be just as Lord Tywin desires. Even terror has its purpose, Cat. Lannister wants to 
provoke us to battle." 
"Robb is like to give him that wish," Catelyn said, fretful. "He is restless as a cat sitting here, and Edmure 
and the Greatjon and the others will urge him on." Her son had won two great victories, smashing Jaime 
Lannister in the Whispering Wood and routing his leaderless host outside the walls of Riverrun in the 
Battle of the Camps, but from the way some of his bannermen spoke of him, he might have been Aegon 
the Conqueror reborn. 
Brynden Blackfish arched a bushy grey eyebrow. "More fool they. My first rule of war, Cat-never give 
the enemy his wish. Lord Tywin would like to fight on a field of his own choosing. He wants us to march 
on Harrenhal." 
"Harrenhal." Every child of the Trident knew the tales told of Harrenhal, the vast fortress that King 
Harren the Black had raised beside the waters of Gods Eye three hundred years past, when the Seven 
Kingdoms had been seven kingdoms, and the riverlands were ruled by the ironmen from the islands. In 
his pride, Harren had desired the highest hall and tallest towers in all Westeros. Forty years it had taken, 
rising like a great 
shadow on the shore of the lake while Harren's armies plundered his neighbors for stone, lumber, gold, 
and workers. Thousands of captives died in his quarries, chained to his sledges, or laboring on his five 
colossal towers. Men froze by winter and sweltered in summer. Weirwoods that had stood three 
thousand years were cut down for beams and rafters. Harren had beggared the riverlands and the Iron 
Islands alike to ornament his dream. And when at last Harrenhal stood complete, on the very day King 
Harren took up residence, Aegon the Conqueror had come ashore at King's Landing. 
Catelyn could remember hearing Old Nan tell the story to her own children, back at Winterfell. "And 
King Harren learned that thick walls and high towers are small use against dragons," the tale always 
ended. "For dragons fly." Harren and all his line had perished in the fires that engulfed his monstrous 
fortress, and every house that held Harrenhal since had come to misfortune. Strong it might be, but it was 
a dark place, and cursed. 
"I would not have Robb fight a battle in the shadow of that keep," Catelyn admitted. "Yet we must do 
something, Uncle." 
"And soon," her uncle agreed. "I have not told you the worst of it, child. The men I sent west have 
Page 72

brought back word that a new host is gathering at Casterly Rock." 
Another Lannister army. The thought made her ill. "Robb must be told at once. Who will command?" 
"Ser Stafford Lannister, it's said." He turned to gaze out over the rivers, his red-and-blue cloak stirring in 
the breeze. 
"Another nephew?" The Lannisters of Casterly Rock were a damnably large and fertile house. 
"Cousin," Ser Brynden corrected. "Brother to Lord Tywin's late wife, so twice related. An old man and 
a bit of a dullard, but he has a son, Ser Daven, who is more formidable." 
"Then let us hope it is the father and not the son who takes this army into the field." 
"We have some time yet before we must face them. This lot will be sellswords, freeriders, and green 
boys from the stews of Lannisport. Ser Stafford must see that they are armed and drilled before he dare 
risk battle . . . and make no mistake, Lord Tywin is not the Kingslayer. He will not rush in heedless. He 
will wait patiently for Ser Stafford to march before he stirs from behind the walls of Harrenhal." 
"Unless . . ." said Catelyn. 
"Yes?" Ser Brynden prompted. 
"Unless he must leave Harrenhal," she said, "to face some other threat." 
Her uncle looked at her thoughtfully. "Lord Renly." 
"King Renly." If she would ask help from the man, she would need to grant him the style he had claimed 
for himself. 
"Perhaps." The Blackfish smiled a dangerous smile. "He'll want something, though." 
"He'll want what kings always want," she said. "Homage." 
CHAPTER 8 
TYRION 
Janos Slynt was a butcher's son, and he laughed like a man chopping meat. "More wine?" Tyrion asked 
him. 
"I should not object," Lord Janos said, holding out his cup. He was built like a keg, and had a similar 
capacity. "I should not object at all. That's a fine red. From the Arbor?" 
"Dornish." Tyrion gestured, and his serving man poured. But for the servants, he and Lord Janos were 
alone in the Small Hall, at a small candlelit table surrounded by darkness. "Quite the find. Dornish wines 
are not often so rich." 
Page 73

"Rich," said the big frog-faced man, taking a healthy gulp. He was not a man for sipping, Janos Slynt. 
Tyrion had made note of that at once. "Yes, rich, that's the very word I was searching for, the very word. 
You have a gift for words, Lord Tyrion, if I might say so. And you tell a droll tale. Droll, yes." 
"I'm pleased you think so . . . but I'm not a lord, as you are. A simple Tyrion will suffice for me, Lord 
Janos." 
"As you wish." He took another swallow, dribbling wine on the front of his black satin doublet. He was 
wearing a clothof-gold half cape fastened with a miniature spear, its point enameled in dark red. And he 
was well and truly drunk. 
Tyrion covered his mouth and belched politely. Unlike Lord Janos he had gone easy on the wine, but he 
was very full. The first thing he had done after taking up residence in the Tower of the Hand was inquire 
after 
the finest cook in the city and take her into his service. This evening they had supped on oxtail soup, 
summer greens tossed with pecans, grapes, red fennel, and crumbled cheese, hot crab pie, spiced 
squash, and quails drowned in butter. Each dish had come with its own wine. Lord Janos allowed that he 
had never eaten half so well. "No doubt that will change when you take your seat in Harrenhal," Tyrion 
said. 
"For a certainty. Perhaps I should ask this cook of yours to enter my service, what do you say?" 
"Wars have been fought over less," he said, and they both had a good long laugh. "You're a bold man to 
take Harrenhal for your seat. Such a grim place, and huge . . . costly to maintain. And some say cursed 
as well." 
"Should I fear a pile of stone?" He hooted at the notion. "A bold man, you said. You must be bold, to 
rise. As I have. To Harrenhal, yes! And why not? You know. You are a bold man too, I sense. Small, 
mayhap, but bold. " 
"You are too kind. More wine?" 
"No. No, truly, I . . . oh, gods be damned, yes. Why not? A bold man drinks his fill!" 
"Truly." Tyrion filled Lord Slynt's cup to the brim. "I have been glancing over the names you put forward 
to take your place as Commander of the City Watch." 
"Good men. Fine men. Any of the six will do, but Id choose Allar Deem. My right arm. Good good 
man. Loyal. Pick him and you won't be sorry. If he pleases the king." 
"To be sure." Tyrion took a small sip of his own wine. "I had been considering Ser Jacelyn Bywater. 
He's been captain on the Mud Gate for three years, and he served with valor during Balon Greyjoy's 
Rebellion. King Robert knighted him at Pyke. And yet his name does not appear on your list." 
Lord Janos Slynt took a gulp of wine and sloshed it around in his mouth for a moment before 
swallowing. "Bywater. Well. Brave man, to be sure, yet . . . he's rigid, that one. A queer dog. The men 
don't like him. A cripple too, lost his hand at Pyke, that's what got him knighted. A poor trade, if you ask 
me, a hand for a ser." He laughed. "Ser Jacelyn thinks overmuch of himself and his honor, as I see it. 
You'll do better leaving that one where he is, my lor-Tyrion. Allar Deem's the man for you." 
Page 74

"Deem is little loved in the streets, I am told." 
"He's feared. That's better." 
"What was it I heard of him? Some trouble in a brothel?" 
"That. Not his fault, my lor-Tyrion. No. He never meant to kill the woman, that was her own doing. He 
warned her to stand aside and let him do his duty." 
"Still . . . mothers and children, he might have expected she'd try to save the babe." Tyrion smiled. "Have 
some of this cheese, it goes splendidly with the wine. Tell me, why did you choose Deem for that 
unhappy task?" 
"A good commander knows his men, Tyrion. Some are good for one job, some for another. Doing for a 
babe, and her still on the tit, that takes a certain sort. Not every man'd do it. Even if it was only some 
whore and her whelp." 
"I suppose that's so," said Tyrion, hearing only some whore and thinking of Shae, and Tysha long ago, 
and all the other women who had taken his coin and his seed over the years. 
Slynt went on, oblivious. "A hard man for a hard job, is Deem. Does as he's told, and never a word 
afterward." He cut a slice off the cheese. "This is fine. Sharp. Give me a good sharp knife and a good 
sharp cheese and I'm a happy man." 
Tyrion shrugged. "Enjoy it while you can. With the riverlands in flame and Renly king in Highgarden, 
good cheese will soon be hard to come by. So who sent you after the whore's bastard?" 
Lord Janos gave Tyrion a wary look, then laughed and wagged a wedge of cheese at him. "You're a sly 
one, Tyrion. Thought you could trick me, did you? it takes more than wine and cheese to make Janos 
Slynt tell more than he should. I pride myself. Never a question, and never a word afterward, not with 
me." 
"As with Deem." 
"Just the same. You make him your Commander when I'm off to Harrenhal, and you won't regret it." 
Tyrion broke off a nibble of the cheese. It was sharp indeed, and veined with wine; very choice. 
"Whoever the king names will not have an easy time stepping into your armor, I can tell. Lord Mormont 
faces the same problem." 
Lord Janos looked puzzled. "I thought she was a lady. Mormont. Beds down with bears, that's the 
one?" 
"It was her brother I was speaking of. Jeor Mormont, the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. 
When I was visiting with him on the Wall, he mentioned how concerned he was about finding a good man 
to take his place. The Watch gets so few good men these days." Tyrion grinned. "He'd sleep easier if he 
had a man like you, I imagine. Or the valiant Allar Deem." 
Lord Janos roared. "Small chance of that!" 
Page 75

"One would think," Tyrion said, "but life does take queer turns. Consider Eddard Stark, my lord. I don't 
suppose he ever imagined his life would end on the steps of Baelor's Sept." 
"There were damn few as did," Lord Janos allowed, chuckling. 
Tyrion chuckled too. "A pity I wasn't here to see it. They say even Varys was surprised." 
Lord Janos laughed so hard his gut shook. "The Spider," he said. "Knows everything, they say. Well, he 
didn't know that." 
"How could he?" Tyrion put the first hint of a chill in his tone. "He had helped persuade my sister that 
Stark should be pardoned, on the condition that he take the black." 
"Eh?" Janos Slynt blinked vaguely at Tyrion. 
"My sister Cersei," Tyrion repeated, a shade more strongly, in case the fool had some doubt who he 
meant. "The Queen Regent." 
"Yes." Slynt took a swallow. "As to that, well . . . the king commanded it, m'lord. The king himself." 
"The king is thirteen," Tyrion reminded him. 
"Still. He is the king." Slynt's jowls quivered when he frowned. "The Lord of the Seven Kingdoms." 
"Well, one or two of them, at least," Tyrion said with a sour smile. "Might I have a look at your spear?" 
"My spear?" Lord Janos blinked in confusion. 
Tyrion pointed. "The clasp that fastens your cape." 
Hesitantly, Lord Janos drew out the ornament and handed it to Tyrion. 
"We have goldsmiths in Lannisport who do better work,[1]he opined. "The red enamel blood is a shade 
much, if you don't mind my saying. Tell me, my lord, did you drive the spear into the man's back yourself, 
or did you only give the command?" 
"I gave the command, and I'd give it again. Lord Stark was a traitor." The bald spot in the middle of 
Slynt's head was beet-red, and his clothof-gold cape had slithered off his shoulders onto the floor. "The 
man tried to buy me." 
"Little dreaming that you had already been sold." 
Slynt slammed down his wine cup. "Are you drunk? If you think I will sit here and have my honor 
questioned . . ." 
"What honor is that? I do admit, you made a better bargain than Ser Jacelyn. A lordship and a castle for 
a spear thrust in the back, and you didn't even need to thrust the spear." He tossed the golden ornament 
back to Janos Slynt. It bounced off his chest and clattered to the floor as the man rose. 
"I mislike the tone of your voice, my lo-Imp. I am the Lord of Har- 
Page 76

renhal and a member of the king's council, who are you to chastise me like this?" 
Tyrion cocked his head sideways. "I think you know quite well who I am. How many sons do you 
have?" 
"What are my sons to you, dwarf?" 
"Dwarf?" His anger flashed. "You should have stopped at Imp. I am Tyrion of House Lannister, and 
someday, if you have the sense the gods gave a sea slug, you will drop to your knees in thanks that it was 
me you had to deal with, and not my lord father. Now, how many sons do you have?" 
Tyrion could see the sudden fear in Janos Slynt's eyes. "Th-three, m'lord. And a daughter. Please, 
m'lord-" 
"You need not beg." He slid off his chair. "You have my word, no harm will come to them. The younger 
boys will be fostered out as squires. If they serve well and loyally, they may be knights in time. Let it 
never be said that House Lannister does not reward those who serve it. Your eldest son will inherit the 
title Lord Slynt, and this appalling sigil of yours." He kicked at the little golden spear and sent it skittering 
across the floor. "Lands will be found for him, and he can build a seat for himself. It will not be Harrenhal, 
but it will be sufficient. it will be up to him to make a marriage for the girl." 
Janos Slynt's face had gone from red to white. "Wh-what . . . what do you . . . ?" His jowls were 
quivering like mounds of suet. 
"What do I mean to do with you?" Tyrion let the oaf tremble for a moment before he answered. "The 
carrack Summer's Dream sails on the morning tide. Her master tells me she will call at Gulltown, the 
Three Sisters, the isle of Skagos, and Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. When you see Lord Commander 
Mormont, give him my fond regards, and tell him that I have not forgotten the needs of the Night's 
Watch. I wish you long life and good service, my lord." 
Once Janos Slynt realized he was not to be summarily executed, color returned to his face. He thrust his 
jaw out. "We will see about this, Imp. Dwarf. Perhaps it will be you on that ship, what do you think of 
that? Perhaps it will be you on the Wall." He gave a bark of anxious laughter. "You and your threats, 
well, we will see. I am the king's friend, you know. We shall hear what Joffrey has to say about this. And 
Littlefinger and the queen, oh, yes. Janos Slynt has a good many friends. We will see who goes sailing, I 
promise you. Indeed we will." 
Slynt spun on his heel like the watchman he'd once been, and strode the length of the Small Hall, boots 
ringing on the stone. He clattered up the steps, threw open the door . . . and came face-to-face with a 
tall, lantern-jawed man in black breastplate and gold cloak. Strapped to the 
stump of his right wrist was an iron hand. "Janos," he said, deep-set eyes glinting under a prominent 
brow ridge and a shock of salt-and-pepper hair. Six gold cloaks moved quietly into the Small Hall behind 
him as Janos Slynt backed away. 
"Lord Slynt," Tyrion called out, "I believe you know Ser Jacelyn Bywater, our new Commander of the 
City Watch." 
"We have a litter waiting for you, my lord," Ser Jacelyn told Slynt. "The docks are dark and distant, and 
the streets are not safe by night. Men." 
Page 77

As the gold cloaks ushered out their onetime commander, Tyrion called Ser Jacelyn to his side and 
handed him a roll of parchment. "It's a long voyage, and Lord Slynt will want for company. See that these 
six join him on the Summer's Dream." 
Bywater glanced over the names and smiled. "As you will." 
"There's one," Tyrion said quietly. "Deem. Tell the captain it would not be taken amiss if that one should 
happen to be swept overboard before they reach Eastwatch." 
"I'm told those northern waters are very stormy, my lord." Ser Jacelyn bowed and took his leave, his 
cloak rippling behind him. He trod on Slynt's cloth-of-gold cape on his way. 
Tyrion sat alone, sipping at what remained of the fine sweet Dornish wine. Servants came and went, 
clearing the dishes from the table. He told them to leave the wine. When they were done, Varys came 
gliding into the hall, wearing flowing lavender robes that matched his smell. "Oh sweetly done, my good 
lord." 
"Then why do I have this bitter taste in my mouth?" He pressed his fingers into his temples. "I told them 
to throw Allar Deem into the sea. I am sorely tempted to do the same with you." 
"You might be disappointed by the result," Varys replied. "The storms come and go, the waves crash 
overhead, the big fish eat the little fish, and I keep on paddling. Might I trouble you for a taste of the wine 
that Lord Slynt enjoyed so much?" 
Tyrion waved at the flagon, frowning. 
Varys filled a cup. "Ah. Sweet as summer." He took another sip. "I hear the grapes singing on my 
tongue." 
"I wondered what that noise was. Tell the grapes to keep still, my head is about to split. It was my sister. 
That was what the oh-so-loyal Lord Janos refused to say. Cersei sent the gold cloaks to that brothel." 
Varys tittered nervously. So he had known all along. 
"You left that part out," Tyrion said accusingly. 
"Your own sweet sister," Varys said, so grief-stricken he looked close to tears. "It is a hard thing to tell a 
man, my lord. I was fearful how you might take it. Can you forgive me?" 
"No," Tyrion snapped. "Damn you. Damn her." He could not touch Cersei, he knew. Not yet, not even 
if he'd wanted to, and he was far from certain that he did. Yet it rankled, to sit here and make a 
mummer's show of justice by punishing the sorry likes of Janos Slynt and Allar Deem, while his sister 
continued on her savage course. "In future, you will tell me what you know, Lord Varys. All of what you 
know." 
The eunuch's smile was sly. "That might take rather a long time, my good lord. I know quite a lot." 
"Not enough to save this child, it would seem." 
"Alas, no. There was another bastard, a boy, older. I took steps to see him removed from harm's way . . 
. but I confess, I never dreamed the babe would be at risk. A baseborn girl, less than a year old, with a 
Page 78

whore for a mother. What threat could she pose?" 
"She was Robert's," Tyrion said bitterly. "That was enough for Cersei, it would seem." 
"Yes. It is grievous sad. I must blame myself for the poor sweet babe and her mother, who was so 
young and loved the king." 
"Did she?" Tyrion had never seen the dead girl's face, but in his mind she was Shae and Tysha both. 
"Can a whore truly love anyone, I wonder? No, don't answer. Some things I would rather not know." He 
had settled Shae in a sprawling stone-and-timber manse, with its own well and stable and garden; he had 
given her servants to see to her wants, a white bird from the Summer Isles to keep her company, silks 
and silver and gemstones to adorn her, guards to protect her. And yet she seemed restive. She wanted to 
be with him more, she told him; she wanted to serve him and help him. "You help me most here, between 
the sheets," he told her one night after their loving as he lay beside her, his head pillowed against her 
breast, his groin aching with a sweet soreness. She made no reply, save with her eyes. He could see 
there that it was not what she'd wanted to hear. 
Sighing, Tyrion started to reach for the wine again, then remembered Lord Janos and pushed the flagon 
away. "It does seem my sister was telling the truth about Stark's death. We have my nephew to thank for 
that madness." 
"King Joffrey gave the command. Janos Slynt and Ser Ilyn Payne carried it out, swiftly, without 
hesitation . . ." 
". . . almost as if they had expected it. Yes, we have been over this ground before, without profit. A 
folly." 
"With the City Watch in hand, my lord, you are well placed to see to it that His Grace commits no 
further . . . follies? To be sure, there is still the queen's household guard to consider . . ." 
"The red cloaks?" Tyrion shrugged. "Vylarr's loyalty is to Casterly Rock. He knows I am here with my 
father's authority. Cersei would find 
it hard to use his men against me . . . besides, they are only a hundred. I have half again as many men of 
my own. And six thousand gold cloaks, if Bywater is the man you claim." 
"You will find Ser Jacelyn to be courageous, honorable, obedient . . . and most grateful." 
"To whom, I wonder?" Tyrion did not trust Varys, though there was no denying his value. He knew 
things, beyond a doubt. "Why are you so helpful, my lord Varys?" he asked, studying the man's soft 
hands, the bald powdered face, the slimy little smile. 
"You are the Hand. I serve the realm, the king, and you." 
"As you served Jon Arryn and Eddard Stark?" 
"I served Lord Arryn and Lord Stark as best I could. I was saddened and horrified by their most 
untimely deaths." 
"Think how I feel. I'm like to be next." 
Page 79

"Oh, I think not," Varys said, swirling the wine in his cup. "Power is a curious thing, my lord. Perchance 
you have considered the riddle I posed you that day in the inn?" 
"It has crossed my mind a time or two," Tyrion admitted. "The king, the priest, the rich man-who lives 
and who dies? Who will the swordsman obey? It's a riddle without an answer, or rather, too many 
answers. All depends on the man with the sword." 
"And yet he is no one," Varys said. "He has neither crown nor gold nor favor of the gods, only a piece of 
pointed steel." 
"That piece of steel is the power of life and death." 
"Just so . . . yet if it is the swordsmen who rule us in truth, why do we pretend our kings hold the power? 
Why should a strong man with a sword ever obey a child king like Joffrey, or a wine-sodden oaf like his 
father? " 
"Because these child kings and drunken oafs can call other strong men, with other swords." 
"Then these other swordsmen have the true power. Or do they? Whence came their swords? Why do 
they obey?" Varys smiled. "Some say knowledge is power. Some tell us that all power comes from the 
gods. Others say it derives from law. Yet that day on the steps of Baelor's Sept, our godly High Septon 
and the lawful Queen Regent and your everso-knowledgeable servant were as powerless as any cobbler 
or cooper in the crowd. Who truly killed Eddard Stark do you think? Joffrey, who gave the command? 
Ser Ilyn Payne, who swung the sword? Or . . . another? " 
Tyrion cocked his head sideways. "Did you mean to answer your damned riddle, or only to make my 
head ache worse?" 
Varys smiled. "Here, then. Power resides where men believe it resides. No more and no less." 
"So power is a mummer's trick?" 
"A shadow on the wall," Varys murmured, "yet shadows can kill. And ofttimes a very small man can cast 
a very large shadow." 
Tyrion smiled. "Lord Varys, I am growing strangely fond of you. I may kill you yet, but I think Id feel 
sad about it." 
"I will take that as high praise." 
"What are you, Varys?" Tyrion found he truly wanted to know. "A spider, they say." 
"Spies and informers are seldom loved, my lord. I am but a loyal servant of the realm." 
"And a eunuch. Let us not forget that." 
"I seldom do." 
"People have called me a halfman too, yet I think the gods have been kinder to me. I am small, my legs 
are twisted, and women do not look upon me with any great yearning . . . yet I'm still a man. Shae is not 
the first to grace my bed, and one day I may take a wife and sire a son. If the gods are good, he'll look 
Page 80

like his uncle and think like his father. You have no such hope to sustain you. Dwarfs are a jape of the 
gods . . . but men make eunuchs. Who cut you, Varys? When and why? Who are you, truly? " 
The eunuch's smile never flickered, but his eyes glittered with something that was not laughter. "You are 
kind to ask, my lord, but my tale is long and sad, and we have treasons to discuss." He drew a 
parchment from the sleeve of his robe. "The master of the King's Galley White Hart plots to slip anchor 
three days hence to offer his sword and ship to Lord Stannis." 
Tyrion sighed. "I suppose we must make some sort of bloody lesson out of the man?" 
"Ser Jacelyn could arrange for him to vanish, but a trial before the king would help assure the continued 
loyalty of the other captains." 
And keep my royal nephew occupied as well. "As you say. Put him down for a dose of Joffrey's 
justice." 
Varys made a mark on the parchment. "Ser Horas and Ser Hobber Redwyne have bribed a guard to let 
them out a postern gate, the night after next. Arrangements have been made for them to sail on the 
Pentoshi galley Moonrunner, disguised as oarsmen." 
"Can we keep them on those oars for a few years, see how they fancy it?" He smiled. "No, my sister 
would be distraught to lose such treasured guests. Inform Ser Jacelyn. Seize the man they bribed and 
explain what an honor it is to serve as a brother of the Night's Watch. And have men posted around the 
Moonrunner, in case the Redwynes find a second guard short of coin." 
"As you will." Another mark on the parchment. "Your man Timett 
slew a wineseller's son this evening, at a gambling den on the Street of Silver. He accused him of 
cheating at tiles." 
"Was it true?" 
"Oh, beyond a doubt." 
"Then the honest men of the city owe Timett a debt of gratitude. I shall see that he has the king's thanks." 
The eunuch gave a nervous giggle and made another mark. "We also have a sudden plague of holy men. 
The comet has brought forth all manner of queer priests, preachers, and prophets, it would seem. They 
beg in the winesinks and pot-shops and foretell doom and destruction to anyone who stops to listen." 
Tyrion shrugged. "We are close on the three hundredth year since Aegon's Landing, I suppose it is only 
to be expected. Let them rant." 
"They are spreading fear, my lord." 
"I thought that was your job." 
Varys covered his mouth with his hand. "You are very cruel to say so. One last matter. Lady Tanda 
gave a small supper last night. I have the menu and the guest list for your inspection. When the wine was 
poured, Lord Gyles rose to lift a cup to the king, and Ser Balon Swann was heard to remark, 'We'll need 
three cups for that.'Many laughed . . ." 
Page 81

Tyrion raised a hand. "Enough. Ser Balon made a jest. I am not interested in treasonous table talk, Lord 
Varys." 
"You are as wise as you are gentle, my lord." The parchment vanished up the eunuch's sleeve. "We both 
have much to do. I shall leave you." 
When the eunuch had departed, Tyrion sat for a long time watching the candle and wondering how his 
sister would take the news of Janos Slynt's dismissal. Not happily, if he was any judge, but beyond 
sending an angry protest to Lord Tywin in Harrenhal, he did not see what Cersei could hope to do about 
it. Tyrion had the City Watch now, plus a hundred-and-a-half fierce clansmen and a growing force of 
sellswords recruited by Bronn. He would seem well protected. 
Doubtless Eddard Stark thought the same. 
The Red Keep was dark and still when Tyrion left the Small Hall. Bronn was waiting in his solar. 
"Slynt?" he asked. 
"Lord Janos will be sailing for the Wall on the morning tide. Varys would have me believe that I have 
replaced one of Joffrey's men with one of my own. More likely, I have replaced Littlefinger's man with 
one belonging to Varys, but so be it." 
"You'd best know, Timett killed a man-" 
"Varys told me." 
The sellsword seemed unsurprised. "The fool figured a one-eyed man would be easier to cheat. Timett 
pinned his wrist to the table with a 
dagger and ripped out his throat barehanded. He has this trick where he stiffens his fingers-" 
"Spare me the grisly details, my supper is sitting badly in my belly," Tyrion said. "How goes your 
recruiting?" 
"Well enough. Three new men tonight." 
"How do you know which ones to hire?" 
"I look them over. I question them, to learn where they've fought and how well they lie." Bronn smiled. 
"And then I give them a chance to kill me, while I do the same for them." 
"Have you killed any?" 
"No one we could have used." 
"And if one of them kills you?" 
"He'll be one you'll want to hire." 
Tyrion was a little drunk, and very tired. "Tell me, Bronn. If I told you to kill a babe . . . an infant girl, 
say, still at her mother's breast . . . would you do it? Without question?" 
Page 82

"Without question? No." The sellsword rubbed thumb and forefinger together. "I'd ask how much." 
And why would I ever need your Allar Deem, Lord Slynt? Tyrion thought. I have a hundred of my own. 
He wanted to laugh; he wanted to weep; most of all, he wanted Shae. 
CHAPTER 9 
ARYA 
The road was little more than two ruts through the weeds. 
The good part was, with so little traffic there'd be no one to point the finger and say which way they'd 
gone. The human flood that had flowed down the kingsroad was only a trickle here. 
The bad part was, the road wound back and forth like a snake, tangling with even smaller trails and 
sometimes seeming to vanish entirely only to reappear half a league farther on when they had all but given 
up hope. Arya hated it. The land was gentle enough, rolling hills and terraced fields interspersed with 
meadows and woodlands and little valleys where willows crowded close to slow shallow streams. Even 
so, the path was so narrow and crooked that their pace had dropped to a crawl. 
It was the wagons that slowed them, lumbering along, axles creaking under the weight of their heavy 
loads. A dozen times a day they had to stop to free a wheel that had stuck in a rut, or double up the 
teams to climb a muddy slope. Once, in the middle of a dense stand of oak, they came face-to-face with 
three men pulling a load of firewood in an ox cart, with no way for either to get around. There had been 
nothing for it but to wait while the foresters unhitched their ox, led him through the trees, spun the cart, 
hitched the ox up again, and started back the way they'd come. The ox was even slower than the 
wagons, so that day they hardly got anywhere at all. 
Arya could not help looking over her shoulder, wondering when the gold cloaks would catch them. At 
night, she woke at every noise to grab 
for Needle's hilt. They never made camp without putting out sentries now, but Arya did not trust them, 
especially the orphan boys. They might have done well enough in the alleys of King's Landing, but out 
here they were lost. When she was being quiet as a shadow, she could sneak past all of them, flitting out 
by starlight to make her water in the woods where no one would see. Once, when Lommy Greenhands 
had the watch, she shimmied up an oak and moved from tree to tree until she was right above his head, 
and he never saw a thing. She would have jumped down on top of him, but she knew his scream would 
wake the whole camp, and Yoren might take a stick to her again. 
Lommy and the other orphans all treated the Bull like someone special now because the queen wanted 
his head, though he would have none of it. "I never did nothing to no queen," he said angrily. "I did my 
work, is all. Bellows and tongs and fetch and carry. I was s'posed to be an armorer, and one day Master 
Mott says I got to join the Night's Watch, that's all I know." Then he'd go off to polish his helm. It was a 
beautiful helm, rounded and curved, with a slit visor and two great metal bull's horns. Arya would watch 
him polish the metal with an oilcloth, shining it so bright you could see the flames of the cookfire reflected 
in the steel. Yet he never actually put it on his head. 
Page 83

"I bet he's that traitor's bastard," Lommy said one night, in a hushed voice so Gendry would not hear. 
"The wolf lord, the one they nicked on Baelor's steps." 
"He is not," Arya declared. My father only had one bastard, and that's Ion. She stalked off into the trees, 
wishing she could just saddle her horse and ride home. She was a good horse, a chestnut mare with a 
white blaze on her forehead. And Arya had always been a good rider. She could gallop off and never see 
any of them, unless she wanted to. Only then she'd have no one to scout ahead of her, or watch behind, 
or stand guard while she napped, and when the gold cloaks caught her, she'd be all alone. It was safer to 
stay with Yoren and the others. 
"We're not far from Gods Eye," the black brother said one morning. "The kingsroad won't be safe till 
we're across the Trident. So we'll come up around the lake along the western shore, they're not like to 
look for us there." At the next spot where two ruts cut cross each other, he turned the wagons west. 
Here farmland gave way to forest, the villages and holdfasts were smaller and farther apart, the hills 
higher and the valleys deeper. Food grew harder to come by. In the city, Yoren had loaded up the 
wagons with salt fish, hard bread, lard, turnips, sacks of beans and barley, and wheels of yellow cheese, 
but every bite of it had been eaten. Forced to live off the land, Yoren turned to Koss and Kurz, who'd 
been taken as poachers. He would send them ahead of the column, into the woods, and 
come dusk they would be back with a deer slung between them on a pole or a brace of quail swinging 
from their belts. The younger boys would be set to picking blackberries along the road, or climbing 
fences to fill a sack with apples if they happened upon an orchard. 
Arya was a skilled climber and a fast picker, and she liked to go off by herself. One day she came 
across a rabbit, purely by happenstance. It was brown and fat, with long ears and a twitchy nose. 
Rabbits ran faster than cats, but they couldn't climb trees half so well. She whacked it with her stick and 
grabbed it by its ears, and Yoren stewed it with some mushrooms and wild onions. Arya was given a 
whole leg, since it was her rabbit. She shared it with Gendry. The rest of them each got a spoonful, even 
the three in manacles. Jaqen H'ghar thanked her politely for the treat, and Biter licked the grease off his 
dirty fingers with a blissful look, but Rorge, the noseless one, only laughed and said, "There's a hunter 
now. Lumpyface Lumpyhead Rabbitkiller." 
Outside a holdfast called Briarwhite, some fieldhands surrounded them in a cornfield, demanding coin for 
the ears they'd taken. Yoren eyed their scythes and tossed them a few coppers. "Time was, a man in 
black was feasted from Dorne to Winterfell, and even high lords called it an honor to shelter him under 
their roofs," he said bitterly. "Now cravens like you want hard coin for a bite of wormy apple." He spat. 
"It's sweetcorn, better'n a stinking old black bird like you deserves," one of them answered roughly. 
"You get out of our field now, and take these sneaks and stabbers with you, or we'll stake you up in the 
corn to scare the other crows away." 
They roasted the sweetcorn in the husk that night, turning the ears with long forked sticks, and ate it hot 
right off the cob. Arya thought it tasted wonderful, but Yoren was too angry to eat. A cloud seemed to 
hang over him, ragged and black as his cloak. He paced about the camp restlessly, muttering to himself. 
The next day Koss came racing back to warn Yoren of a camp ahead. "Twenty or thirty men, in mail 
and halfhelms," he said. "Some of them are cut up bad, and one's dying, from the sound of him. With all 
the noise he was making, I got right up close. They got spears and shields, but only one horse, and that's 
lame. I think they been there awhile, from the stink of the place." 
Page 84

"See a banner?" 
"Spotted treecat, yellow and black, on a mud-brown field." 
Yoren folded a sourleaf into his mouth and chewed. "Can't say," he admitted. "Might be one side, might 
be t'other. if they're hurt that bad, likely they'd take our mounts no matter who they are. Might be they'd 
take more than that. I believe we'll go wide around them." It took them miles out of their way, and cost 
them two days at the least, but the old 
man said it was cheap at the price. "You'll have time enough on the Wall. The rest o' your lives, most 
like. Seems to me there's no rush to get there. " 
Arya saw men guarding the fields more and more when they turned north again. Often they stood silently 
beside the road, giving a cold eye to anyone who passed. Elsewhere they patrolled on horses, riding their 
fence lines with axes strapped to their saddles. At one place, she spotted a man perched up in a dead 
tree, with a bow in his hand and a quiver hanging from the branch beside him. The moment he spied 
them, he notched an arrow to his bowstring, and never looked away until the last wagon was out of sight. 
All the while, Yoren cursed. "Him in his tree, let's see how well he likes it up there when the Others come 
to take him. He'll scream for the Watch then, that he will." 
A day later Dobber spied a red glow against the evening sky. "Either this road went and turned again, or 
that sun's setting in the north." 
Yoren climbed a rise to get a better look. "Fire," he announced. He licked a thumb and held it up. "Wind 
should blow it away from us. Still bears watching." 
And watch it they did. As the world darkened, the fire seemed to grow brighter and brighter, until it 
looked as though the whole north was ablaze. From time to time, they could even smell the smoke, 
though the wind held steady and the flames never got any closer. By dawn the fire had burned itself out, 
but none of them slept very well that night. 
it was midday when they arrived at the place where the village had been. The fields were a charred 
desolation for miles around, the houses blackened shells. The carcasses of burnt and butchered animals 
dotted the ground, under living blankets of carrion crows that rose, cawing furiously, when disturbed. 
Smoke still drifted from inside the holdfast. Its timber palisade looked strong from afar, but had not 
proved strong enough. 
Riding out in front of the wagons on her horse, Arya saw burnt bodies impaled on sharpened stakes 
atop the walls, their hands drawn up tight in front of their faces as if to fight off the flames that had 
consumed them. Yoren called a halt when they were still some distance off, and told Arya and the other 
boys to guard the wagons while he and Murch and Cutjack went in on foot. A flock of ravens rose from 
inside the walls when they climbed through the broken gate, and the caged ravens in their wagons called 
out to them with quorks and raucous shrieks. 
"Should we go in after them?" Arya asked Gendry after Yoren and the others had been gone a long 
time. 
"Yoren said wait." Gendry's voice sounded hollow. When Arya turned to look, she saw that he was 
wearing his helm, all shiny steel and great curving horns. 
Page 85

When they finally returned, Yoren had a little girl in his arms, and Murch and Cutjack were carrying a 
woman in a sling made of an old torn quilt. The girl was no older than two and she cried all the time, a 
whimpery sound, like something was caught in her throat. Either she couldn't talk yet or she had forgotten 
how. The woman's right arm ended in a bloody stump at her elbow, and her eyes didn't seem to see 
anything, even when she was looking right at it. She talked, but she only said one thing. "Please," she 
cried, over and over. "Please. Please." Rorge thought that was funny. He laughed through the hole in his 
face where his nose had been, and Biter started laughing too, until Murch cursed them and told them to 
shut up. 
Yoren had them fix the woman a place in the back of a wagon. "And be quick about it," he said. "Come 
dark, there'll be wolves here, and worse." 
"I'm scared," Hot Pie murmured when he saw the one-armed woman thrashing in the wagon. 
"Me too," Arya confessed. 
He squeezed her shoulder. "I never truly kicked no boy to death, Arry. I just sold my mommy's pies, is 
all." 
Arya rode as far ahead of the wagons as she dared, so she wouldn't have to hear the little girl crying or 
listen to the woman whisper, "Please." She remembered a story Old Nan had told once, about a man 
imprisoned in a dark castle by evil giants. He was very brave and smart and he tricked the giants and 
escaped . . . but no sooner was he outside the castle than the Others took him, and drank his hot red 
blood. Now she knew how he must have felt. 
The one-armed woman died at evenfall. Gendry and Cutjack dug her grave on a hillside beneath a 
weeping willow. When the wind blew, Arya thought she could hear the long trailing branches whispering, 
"Please. Please. Please." The little hairs on the back of her neck rose, and she almost ran from the 
graveside. 
"No fire tonight," Yoren told them. Supper was a handful of wild radishes Koss found, a cup of dry 
beans, water from a nearby brook. The water had a funny taste to it, and Lommy told them it was the 
taste of bodies, rotting someplace upstream. Hot Pie would have hit him if old Reysen hadn't pulled them 
apart. 
Arya drank too much water, just to fill her belly with something. She never thought she'd be able to 
sleep, yet somehow she did. When she woke, it was pitch-black and her bladder was full to bursting. 
Sleepers huddled all around her, wrapped in blankets and cloaks. Arya found Needle, stood, listened. 
She heard the soft footfalls of a sentry, men turning in restless sleep, Rorge's rattling snores, and the 
queer hissing sound that 
Biter made when he slept. From a different wagon came the steady rhythmic scrape of steel on stone as 
Yoren sat, chewing sourleaf and sharpening the edge of his dirk. 
Hot Pie was one of the boys on watch. "Where you going?" he asked when he saw Arya heading for the 
trees. 
Arya waved vaguely at the woods. 
"No you're not," Hot Pie said. He had gotten bolder again now that he had a sword on his belt, even 
though it was just a shortsword and he handled it like a cleaver. "The old man said for everyone to stay 
Page 86

close tonight." 
"I need to make water," Arya explained. 
"Well, use that tree right there." He pointed. "You don't know what's out there, Arry. I heard wolves
